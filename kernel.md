# Digimon
The main inhabitants of the digital world.
While the digiworld has a much longer history than one might think, only the current major version is relevant, in which digimon are data-based lifeforms.
That is, like the digiworld itself, their coming into existence is ultimately around data in the human world.

Because any data which can exist (and if you're thinking, the Digimon Reference Book says *code* rather than data, remember that only tiny microcontrollers are harvard-architecture) that isn't purely random has *some* purpose to it, digimon have at least traces of that purpose to them, at least when freshly created.
Some digimon keep this purpose, and thus you have things like burgamon whose entire existence revolves around fast food.
Metal Empire digimon are the most likely to do this, being overtly machines.

The second common thing for digimon to do is to gradually become feral, the fauna and random encounters of the digiworld.
How smart these are varies, as does how obvious it is that there's something between the ears; it varies with species as well as the individual, such as Seadramon is almost always a fairly bestial brawn-over-brains sea serpent.

Thirdly, a digimon may adopt a mentality imitating a more human one, resulting in villages and towns and so forth, not to mention adventurers.

But there is a fourth possibility, namely to have a tamer.

# Tamers
Some humans are, as it were, on the same wavelength as a digimon.
Should they ever *meet* that mon, it's quite likely that the pair will hit it off.
With a digivice around, the "bond" becomes more than psychological, and mon and human become connected to a greater degree.
At this point, you have a tamer.

At this point you *also* have the first stage of matrix or spirit evolution.

In any case, one of the signature properties of a tamer is that human emotion and psychology interacts with digimon to facilitate the latter's growth, adding new code based to an often considerable degree on on the thoughts, memories, and emotions in question.
This works even for feral or pure functional digimon, if anything it works *especially* well for them, for the major expansion the mon experiences is *mental*.
Big and strong is just a digimon thing, it's the brain parts that benefit most from a tamer, which admittedly does feed back into strength.

Parenthetically, this is why the Gennais prefer to tap children as tamers.
Not only are the kids more likely to jump at the call to adventure, but they're more likely to have a mindset that lets them grow along with their friends/"mascots" without so many care mistakes.
And care mistakes are a big deal: get it right, that Koromon becomes a legendary world-saving Wargreymon.
Get it wrong, you get a Machinedramon willing to *use* that city-flattening destructive power, or worse (managing to somehow kill the mon is, in a needs-of-the-many sort of way, one of the better possible results).

This connection flows another way: digimon protect their tamers even if that protection couldn't have any physical basis.
If you have a digimon, you gain the toughness needed for feats like riding your Greymon into battle, or even *lifting* Zudomon's hammer much less hammering things with it.

## Spirit tamers
Some humans don't match up with a digimon, but with a Spirit (despite the name, these are physical objects), perhaps finding it in a shrine.

Spirit taming is actually more demanding in some respects than having a digimon partner: it's almost the same mechanism as jogress but almost all of the things that make the result animate come from the tamer.
As a result, the tamer is as wiped out afterwards as the mon would be.
This is all because Spirits, being "fossilised" digimon, lack fundamental components of the "event loop" variety, but it's no harder to bodge a human's to fit than it is another digimon's.

It's also incompatible with having a partner, the same "ports" are occupied by the spirit, and it's impossible to create a viable multiplexer that accomodates both.
If you try to force the issue, Bad Things happen.
Rampages, unconsciousness, unintentional transformation, the whole nine yards.

The effect of mental compatibility here extends to how well spirit evolution works: none at all, and you get none at all, while Takuya, being a first-rate goggleboy, could use Agunimon pretty well.

## Becoming a tamer
All that's really required is that human and mon encounter one another for long enough to start bonding, and then a digivice turn up to facilitate the full connection forming.
In practice this means the tamer gets given a digivice by someone who has access to a maker of such.

Most commonly, a Gennai will arrange for a promising human to encounter a suitable digimon.
Part of the definition of "promising" is jumping at the call to adventure.
Quite aside of it being quite an expedition to get between the worlds, where tamers are, some sort of adventure is likely to follow.
That's why the Gennais have their program of identifying potential tamers, invariably middle school kids or so for high potential and lower chance of care mistakes.

The various Data Squad branches also have their recruitment operations, though they have somewhat different criteria, young adults or outright adults who are trained before being matched with a digimon (or assigned to some other role).

# Non-digimon
Besides digimon and humans, there are several other kinds of thing that aren't just inanimate objects.
Truly inert inanimate objects form the bulk of the digiworld, they work pretty much how you'd expect. Food is edible, trees have leaves, the ground is solid, all that. But there are other things which aren't so inert but don't qualify as being a digimon, sometimes for purely technical reasons.

In particular, digimon are able to digivolve, by definition, and have quite a lot of capacity for intelligence even if it's going unused.

## Gennais
These somewhat mysterious entities generally look like humans in some sort of monastic outfit.
While they don't discuss their origins they do freely admit their job is to look after the digital world, balance order and chaos, and so forth.
They don't seem to directly be agents of Yggdrasil, not the way the Royal Knights are.
Rumour has it that they might be based on a digitised human, but all that's definitely known is, they can't digivolve and thus aren't digimon.

It is the Gennais that are responsible for the creation of most digivices and summoning humans to become Chosen Ones.
They appear now and then to give people missions or help with an existing mission that's within their purview.
Mostly, however, the Gennais work behind the scenes giving things little nudges and maintaining internal mechanisms of the digiworld.

## Spirits
Spirits are sort of fossils of digimon. Lacking fundamental parts (think "event loop", for instance), they are inert objects unless attached to a human or digimon.
This requires mental compatibility, like canon Agunimon really needs to be used by... well, someone as goggleboy-y as Takuya is.
There's a very basic harness in a spirit's shrine, but it's not really enough for the spirit to *do* much.
Compatibility comes in degrees, the more you have it the better spirit evolution works for you.

## Artifacts
These are more animate than a brick, but don't rise to the level of being a digimon.
Essentially they're the magic items of the digiworld, some require a sort of attunement process to use successfully; some even have a bit of tendency or preference of their own.
There's an upper limit on how autonomous an artifact can be before it becomes a digimon, so if that's not desired the designers generally make it so a more extensive attunement is required.

Basically a mon jacks in and the relevant functions are borrowed by the artifact.
This process works even if the mon has a tamer, or is a spirit tamer in digimon form.

### Digivices
Facilitates the bond between tamer and digimon.
Humans *can* make these, but most are created by the Gennais.
Quite different processes are employed in each case, but the result is largely similar.
Human-made digivices aren't as efficient, though, which is partly why the Data Squad tamers have to be more highly trained; they don't make influencing the mon, or digivolving from the human's impetus, as easy as the ones the Chosen have.

The designers of digivices have heard of convergence and dismissed the concept: digivices are quite specialised, so it's not worth the R&D to make them be general-purpose handheld computers.
It's more effective to give the digivice a way to interface with one, such as bluetooth.

That said, sometimes a digivice *can* detect the distance and direction to a significant object, or report on the time until some significant event, but this can hardly be relied upon.
Probably this functionality is invoked by a Gennai somehow.

Calculations show that it would not be hard to design a digivice that can contain the linked digimon, v-pet style.
It is also verified to be extremely hard to separate a tamer or mon from the digivice and keep them separate; quite aside from this being less effective than one may like, somehow they find a way to retrieve it.

### Crests/Tags
Item representing an emotion or mental quality, that can give a boost to a digimon and its tamer (usually this translates to easier digivolution).
Strictly speaking it's the Crest that does this, the Tag is just an adapter to make it easier to hold both physically and mentally.
Few examples exist, though the traits they represent form groups that pop up in themeing all over the place, like some cosmic force likes reusing the names for any set of the appropriate number of things.

Much to the vexation of the Gennais, and indeed the Data Squad, the mental qualities are not actually required to be positive, although it is rare to see any mention of this fact let alone an actual Crest Of, say, Rage or Hatred.
The knowledge that these *can* exist, let alone the possibility that they *have* to for reasons of cosmic balance, is not something either group wants to be known in case anyone gets... ideas.

## Livestock/Fodder
Now with the amount of carnivorous digimon and the fact that there’s an actual, real preference for meat discussed quite frequently by beasts thrice your size, you’d think you were on the menu.
Apparently the laws of biology and physics are ignored and as if by some kind of joke meat DOES grow from the earth, their taste being actually quite richer from the ones back at your place.
And while buying and selling them is a thing, the farmers usually are friendly enough to give you a few chunks of meat for you to share with your digimon.
After all, they claim to have been helped by quite a few so-called gentlemen back in the past, although what that word means is lost to them.
The older of the bunch will probably ask you if gentleman is just an evolution after human, much to the humor of most.

Because the same cosmic principles that are amused by the inclusion of an entire seed catalogue of meat plants also like symmetry, there are animals, not rising to the level of intellect, firepower, or other abilities of even the most feral digimon, which grow fruit, leaves, and other edible plant matter. as part of themselves.
These are farmed as much as regular plants are, although it's more ranching than anything a human farmer would do with grain or the like. 

There's also simple plants that verge on being part of the scenery, but are distinguished by their edibility... at least if you're the right kind of digimon.
