# Data Squad
The title is slightly a misnomer, as individual national agencies have different names, but among those who know of them the name has caught on as a kind of shorthand for whatever the relevant agency is, mostly because of the UN project to organise them.
In this book the abbreviation "DS" will show up frequently.

## History
After the events of Shinjiku in 2004, the Japanese government could no longer cover the existence of digimon to the rest of the world nor that of the chosen children.
Due mostly to the fact that said children now were international rather than Japanese-born, and the fact that they required said digidestined to stop a creature capable of wiping out humanity.
They were literally relying on a miracle at that point since no modern weaponry could even scrath the D-Reaper, even a nuke would be but a minor inconvenience to that thing, and perhaps even aiding it.

Upon meeting, The United Nations decided to initiate project Data Squad, a decentralized organization all over the world in charge of dealing with digimon that end up in the human world.
Either helping them find a good tamer to bond if they are tame enough, or in the worst case, eliminating said target.
While there was a time Data Squad scouted for Digidestined, the conflict from both parties rose as the kind of chosen that could make good soldiers would usually be against the more… ”Just following orders” side of the organization.

## Present
The Data Squad began to scout for people with skills and that had been witness to digimon activity, but had not been paired with a digimon.
They are then trained, given a digivice and a digimon to take care of and then sent to missions either in the real world or in the digital world.
Despite the name, the “digivice” created by Data Squad is vastly inferior to that of the Chosen, but can still evolve their digimon under regular circumstances and if all the conditions are met.
However, they are much more specialized and learned than your regular middle school kid, as usually Data Squad agents are young adults at their youngest.

Many of those prospective agents who don't make the cut for being issued a digiegg continue to work for the DS as support staff or researchers.
This happens with some frequency, as the recruiters have never perfected the art of finding potential tamers, nor have the psychologists and digimon experts (that is, experts on digimon, whether they are mons themselves or not) perfected the art of making only working matches.
This is partly due to the finite supply of humans and even more limited supply of eggs; even with the Gennais' advanced diagnostic tools they would be limited to what they have on hand and can thus only make the best available match.

Occasionally it doesn't work out, tamer and mon don't click for each other, and they split.
Ones who are fired or quit after this... well, let's just say some of them disappear into the underworld.
Many, however, stay on, perhaps being tried with other possible partners, or just working independently; any organisation like this needs more than just field agents.

## Relation to Chosen Ones
Since the Data Squad have different goals (lots, being more of an international association of more local bodies rather than a unified command) to the Gennais, they rarely actively work together.
However, when they *do* spot a Chosen whose goals align with the DS, they often offer some degree of assistance.

## Science
A lot of the neat toys any of the Data Squads have are basically reverse engineered from studies of digimon and digimon-related items.
To this end, the larger agencies maintain research laboratories to study digimon and so forth.
Mostly these are hidden from the public by clearly labelling them as government research facilities.

In particular, this is where human-built digivices came from; the Gennai-built ones are built using a process that is at best extremely difficult for humans to replicate.
Fortunately the basic functionality isn't dependent on using this process, albeit that human technology struggles to achieve specs on a par with Gennai-tech, at least on paper.

This is less important than it sounds, as paper specifications never tell the whole story, not at all.
In practice for the core functionality that's why anyone has a digivice to begin with, DS digivices function on par with those used by the Chosen.
Mostly what's missing is ancillary functions and robustness to certain extreme operating scenarios.

While programmes of improvements to this technology continue, the various DS labs now focus more on other areas.
First is the way the human and digital worlds can get close; the holy grail is generating portals on demand to a known location and spotting digimon in transit before they materialise in the human world.
At the moment, the state of the art is very expensively teleporting things from the lab to *somewhere* in the digiworld, recovering a beacon-marked object sent via such transit if beacon and portal have run for this time, and spotting digimon soon after materialisation.
Most DS missions rely on pre-existing "thin areas" where transit can be provoked.

Second is the study of digimon themselves.
Mostly this is as one might expect for biological research, even if digimon aren't quite biological; a lot of the approaches carry over.
Studying how digivolution works is unique to mons, though.

There are persistent rumours of breakthroughs that are being hushed up even to DS staff with security clearances, even that there are rogue labs with perfected artificial spirits or even complete digimon.
There's almost no evidence of this, but one set of rumours hangs together a little *too* well:
That some of the tamers supposedly fired for doing the work unnecessarily dirtily, were actually reassigned as test subjects for experiments into artificial spirit evolution and while so transformed serve as some of the untamed but DS-aligned digimon that are suspected to do the really dirty work.
