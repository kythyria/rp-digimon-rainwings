# Lovelace, the starting town

Aside from the train station that dominates the skyline, a strange sight will greet you. 
Buildings meshed together with nether rhyme nor reason, neon signs that look futuristic pointing at houses and small business that are as rural as you might imagine, or buildings made out of wood and stone that combined form a strange and almost chaotic form of symmetry that makes no sense-yet does at the same time.
Some of these buildings have doors that only a kid and a digimon can pass through without much problem, leaving theories as to what-or who might have constructed this place in the minds of adults that might need to crouch uncomfortably to get inside. 
Statues and decorations constructed with the most random items you could ever think of pointing at different locations, growing in strangeness the further you walk from the center of this bizarre town. 
Strangely, the road will simply cut off into wilderness, not even a trail of rocks follows and venturing around the surface might end up with you getting attacked by rookie-level digimon that are a bit too feral to care about dealing with whatever problem they have with you through dialogie.

## The Station
Oh yes, speaking of the station.

The very first place humans are likely to see is the Station, usually by accident: it's easy to just warp into the station accidentally, because reality is so thin there and train stations exist in order to travel anyway. But if you're on the platforms it's still a U-shaped Victorian neo-gothic edifice, all red brick and slightly pointy or perfectly circular arches and window frames with sandstone accents. Then between the arms soars an enormous, also slightly pointy, cast iron and rivet frame holding up a mostly glass roof and the huge floodlamps that light the space at night. They're clearly not lamps of human manufacture, involving crystals and lenses, but still lamps.

It's hard to tell from inside, but the platforms are on the second floor. While you could go through the big arch at the front front (as big digimon often do), most travellers go down the stairs onto the main concourse, at first glance like any other terminus concourse: the ticket offices, shops catering to travellers in a hurry, departure boards, all that jazz. But most of the text is digimoji, and the travellers are mostly digimon. Indeed, the relatively low ceilings of the concourse must be cramped for some of the bigger ones. If you don't get sidetracked by the stairs down to the *other* platforms, lunch, or the warren of corridors that the ends of the main concourse degenerate into, you can walk out the side doors into the town proper.

Oh, and at night the station changes quite a bit. The trains have wildly different livery matching the different trailmon drawing them, fair enough. But downstairs is a different matter. The lights change their spectrum, yellowing noticeably. There are alleyways where there weren't alleyways before *inside* the station, and different shops are open. If you look closely, some of them were clearly hiding behind a hologram during the day. And much shadier types walk around much more openly, or are behind the counter of the shops, or even just in the less well-lit corridors with little stalls or just a longcoat with pockets. The merchandise is correspondingly... not something you'd buy in broad daylight, or always well described: caveat emptor is in full force at this time.

## Data Squad Outpost
As you reach outside, the sea of digimon will no doubt confuse the majority of arrivals, that is until you veer your head to the closest building from the station’s exit: what appears to be a small police booth not far from you.
Entering it will greet you with a bunch of creatures and humans alike walking about, albeit the first wearing what could only be described as multicolored track suits with a rather oddly-designed jacket atop of it.
The initials DS engraved somewhere on this strange, and rather tacky, uniform.
Those who venture here first might be informed of the situation they are in, and how important it is for them to learn the purpose of their visit.
After all, danger is always present in the digiworld, especially if you brought no lil’ monster to accompany you.

## Burgamon Bar
The aroma of food might draw in those with a palate for bread and potatoes, not far from it being a first encounter with the most peculiar digimon business: A fast food restaurant that specializes in burgers, French fries and fruit juice-Why not soda you ask?
They will most likely look at you dumbfounded and ask you if this “soda” you speak of is a friend of yours.
However, just by looking at the staff might give you an idea as to the source of their confusion: Digimon themed after hamburgers and potatoes – Burgermon and Potamon.
The strangest thing about this is the fact that they do not seek financial compensation for their services, and are more than happy to just watch others eat their cooking. 
Where they get the ingredients for their non-profit expedition into the culinary arts is a mystery even for some of the older residents, but the majority have learned to deal with it.
I mean, who doesn’t like free burgers?

## The Gym
And as if to mock those that come for an unhealthy meal, the store in front of it, rather than food, sells a lifestyle.
A dojo specialized in digimon is not shy on showing its customers training and fighting machines that would otherwise kill a human.
Perhaps one of the few doors where a person might not need to crouch allows the entering to this world of rugged, large digimon and small alike, pumping iron, punching bags of sand and some rather extreme forms of exercises like literally detonating a bomb on themselves as part of a normal, physical endurance regime.
Of course, registering and paying a fee might come as a surprise after the free banquet, but for those looking for strength it might be a small price to pay for strength.

## The clinic
However, those that venture untrained, without having challenged the gym or with a digimon that might find itself countered by the local digimon, might find themselves in a small clinic of a single floor being attended by a sistermon and an angemon, who are quite knowledgeable in treating not only digimon, but even humans that might’ve found themselves in the crossfire.
Perhaps knowledge imparted to them by the DS, or from their previous tamer, although being asked that often proves foolish as they’ll either ignore it or give a different answer each time.

There exists other places that specifically exchange money for services, but these are to be found by anyone curious enough.

# Mugen City
"Waste not want not" is something the digital world takes seriously, to the point where the undying body of a titan-sized machinedramon, rather than to be wasted by the eons of time and digimon looking for an easy prey, became a city bristling with life and commerce. The hardware of the creature became housing and industry, while its circuitry has been tooled and fixed to redistribute power to the many houses. Due to the nature of a digimon, this creature is being kept alive by its inhabitants, the CPU held in one of the most secure places in the city as to keep their livelihood running at all times. Now how did things end up the way they are? One running theory is that this giant Machinedramon was being built in a massive factory in order to attack other continents for resources, something failed and said massive digimon went berserker, destroying everything (including itself) bar the life support that kept its remains running long enough for it to be found and repurposed into a city.

However it happened, the infrastructure of the city is now a bewildering tangle that nearly defies explanation,
even to digimon engineers who understand the operating principles of individual components.
This is perhaps no surprise: The only coherent design notes covering the entire system in any state were made by the
original founders, and centuries of modification and expansion have buried the original vision under patchwork extensions,
jury-rigs, repurposings, emergency repairs, and so forth.

Thus nobody knows the full extent, schematics, or how much of it works, just keep it patched up and assume that the machine
digimon themeing that shows up around the place is just an aesthetic oddity.
Probably a good idea to ignore the number of techs that had nervous breakdowns or retired to become tulip farmers.
It might also be best to ignore the rumours that in places you can hear *words* in the hum of transformers and clicking of relays,
rumours that sometimes when the lights flicker the perfectly normal modern signs change to say Yggdrasil knows what in
an ancient script that makes even mechanical eyes water if looked at closely.

And it's *definitely* best not to look too closely at the oldest structures or behind the rusted access panels with the
sigil of the founders on.
Even the most experienced engineers with encyclopaedic knowledge of the city's systems hesitate to fiddle with
some of *those*, even just moving patch pins or turning knobs, not without a reference for which ones will clear the fault.
Actually using the event taps--an antique method of jacking in--is right out, *nobody* knows what most of those connect to.

# Atlantas City
Deep within the bowels of The Great George Gorges lies a hidden city encapsulated in a bubble, where aquatic digimon call home. Thanks to the extremely variable and elastic form of the train rails and the train digimon itself having some minor flexion on what it appeared at first to be inflexible metal, it is possible to visit this place. The large bubble covering this floating mass protects any and all of its subjects and buildings from damage and predators, albeit they are not shy as to not use weaponry against anything big enough going their way real fast, ergo it is often not recommendable to go without a pass or not using the train. Incredibly enough, it is a suburb where regular digimon can work and, thanks to some special coding, the floor apparently does not give even against the heaviest digimon-Although you'll probably end up knocking a few buildings if you try to go big enough.

# Heavenly Arm
It is unknown how or why there's a massive arm floating aimlessly around the digital world, some rumors speak of a battle between the god of war and the god of comraderie fighting with their digimon, the beast of blue ripping an arm from the warrior or valour and throwing it to the air, a symbol of its thriump, while the legendary warrior had to replace its now lost limb with cold, unfeeling metal. Wherever as it may be, the data of the arm is...strange, it is almost impossible to properly analyze, modern techniques only give static. However, due to the sheer size, some digimon had decided to live there, and on the palm a Sky-Hop was erected.

## Sky-hop
Another possible entry point. For some reason there's a pancake place waaay up in a Sky biome. Maybe birds like pancakes?
Either way, it's up there, and universally considered neutral territory. Rumour has it one of the rooms is entangled
with the human world, but that's just a rumour. More confirmed is that the humanoid part of an Apocalymon sometimes eats
pancakes there.

# Kyle Mountain
An unforgiving, giant snow mountain said to be surrounded by berserker digimon, a cold environment that creates dispute for resources and an almost relentless desire for bloodlust. Although it is not because of some spell or evil entity that wishes to make that place its own, as was originally thought. In fact, it is because of a fruit called a "Dew fruit" that, those that ingest it without processing it properly, will go into a berserking state, trashing and destroying anything on its path. Due to this, the fruit is sought after as, the drink made out of the fruit is said to boost a digimon's constitution, sharpen their minds and make them ready for action in a yiff! The locals call it the "Spiral Mountain Dew" and it is considered a national treasure.

# Petaldramon Oasis
It is said that an enormous petaldramon was at the brink of death, having found itself in the middle of the scorching desert for reason yet to be discovered. The first settlers found this dying digimon and, seeing unlimited possibilities by taming this behemoth, decided to restore it to its full health. It took several year, but what was once nothing but a dying, dried-up branch became a massive beast that held atop its back what could be considered a full-on forest. Those that saw the fruits of their labor were welcomed aboard it, and after eating its fruits discovered that the beast produced amazing food. With that, they dedicated themselves to farming and producing delicacies the digiworld has never seen before, creating atop the beast a floral paradise. The most interesting thing was that, seeing as they were farming ATOP a digimon and the vines and trees were as part of its body as any other, being able to decipher how much fertilizer, water and how to combat possible parasites and infections became so easy it was almost laughable! Even an idiot could create a paradise of their own atop the digimon.

This of course brought in more and more digimon who wanted a piece of that land as, despite the massive size of the beast, greed always runs through the code of those that taste success. However, an interesting thing to note, is that the hardwork of the settlers did not only benefit them, but also the petaldramon, as trading commenced with other regions and thus, manure, nutrients and settlers were traded back and forth, and while one might wonder why the beast might love its population: It is because of the fights they often have atop it, often times deleting their own and thus, seeping into the monster more and more data of which it consumes and grows stronger, forming better fruit. This is one of the reasons why the creature often follows the scent of powerful digimon, even if its movement is sluggish, in order to consume more and more data, be it the diginutrients, of those foolish enough to desire power and money atop its back.
