# Humans and Digimon

# Non-digimon
Besides, digimon, humans, and whatever the Gennais are, there are several other kinds of thing that aren't just inanimate objects.

## Spirits
Spirits are sort of fossils of digimon. Lacking fundamental parts (think "event loop", for instance), they are inert objects unless attached to a human or digimon.
This requires mental compatibility, like canon Agunimon really needs to be used by... well, someone as goggleboy-y as Takuya is.
There's a very basic harness in a spirit's shrine, but it's not really enough for the spirit to *do* much.
Compatibility comes in degrees, the more you have it the better spirit evolution works for you.

## Artifacts
These are more animate than a brick, but don't rise to the level of being a digimon.
Essentially they're the magic items of the digiworld, some require a sort of attunement process to use successfully; some even have a bit of tendency or preference of their own.
There's an upper limit on how autonomous an artifact can be before it becomes a digimon, so if that's not desired the designers generally make it so a more extensive attunement is required.

Basically a mon jacks in and the relevant functions are borrowed by the artifact.
This process works even if the mon has a tamer, or is a spirit tamer in digimon form.

## Livestock
It's not *just* a mon-eat-mon world out there; there are simple plants and animals that produce food and other materials, but which also don't rise to the level of being even a feral digimon.
But if you were expecting there to not be meat plants or salad chickens, you were mistaken, both exist, as do soup mines, rock farms, and refrigerators just sort of standing around in the middle of nowhere inexplicably full of fresh eggs.

# Digital World Geography

Trailmon lines go to some weird places.
There's at least one station in the middle of inky black primordial void, and it's not a terminus.
There's places where the rail "prop" and the lineness don't even pretend to line up.
One station is configured to resemble a (pre bogie-exchange) gauge change station, even though there's no visible reason.

Some of these are required by mathematical theorems underpinning the trailmon network.  
Some are _not_.

Other places... there's very few automobiles.
Most transport is trailmon, artificial trains, riding another mon, or digivolving into something suitable.
Yes, you can hire a private railcar or an entire train.
There's rumours of some kid who got a trailmon partner and found a way for it to rez momentary rails _wherever it likes_
(he has to control this manually, trailmon are surprisingly resistant to the concept of corners).

There's a few cities, though new tamers don't start in one.
Rather more small towns and villages: you'll get tiny villages that are more or less monospecies.
Even random installations like a cafe in the middle of nowhere.
Towns vary a bit more: most have a single trailmon line.

Another cause of random installations and villages is navigable waterways: locks, lifts, and bridges sometimes have a mon looking after them.
Yes, there's boats, sometimes mon-hauled, or you can just ride an aquatic mon if you don't mind getting wet (or have a Submarimon).
You might need a narrowboat to get up some of the thinner canals; it's not the fastest way to get around, but there's sizeable chunks of land with no railway.
This includes a desert where you can also sail in a sandboat and fish for desert-themed digimon.

The digiworld considers euclidean geometry to be for boring people.
The aforementioned desert, for instance, has a canal across it that is quite a bit shorter if you're floating on it.
Indoor spaces have a disconcerting tendency to straight up be in a different worldspace, so subway lines have very different lengths and routes to what you'd expect from station placement.
Heck, there's a forest with a high-rise tree where climbing a ladder into the permanent cloud at the top takes you to someplace quite different (but beware, where it comes out changes without warning).
