# Digimon
The main inhabitants of the digital world.
While the digiworld has a much longer history than one might think, only the current major version is relevant, in which digimon are data-based lifeforms.
That is, like the digiworld itself, their coming into existence is ultimately around data in the human world.

Because any data which can exist (and if you're thinking, the Digimon Reference Book says *code* rather than data, remember that only tiny microcontrollers are harvard-architecture) that isn't purely random has *some* purpose to it, digimon have at least traces of that purpose to them, at least when freshly created.
Some digimon keep this purpose, and thus you have things like burgamon whose entire existence revolves around fast food.
Metal Empire digimon are the most likely to do this, being overtly machines.

The second common thing for digimon to do is to gradually become feral, the fauna and random encounters of the digiworld.
How smart these are varies, as does how obvious it is that there's something between the ears; it varies with species as well as the individual, such as Seadramon is almost always a fairly bestial brawn-over-brains sea serpent.

Thirdly, a digimon may adopt a mentality imitating a more human one, resulting in villages and towns and so forth, not to mention adventurers.

But there is a fourth possibility, namely to have a tamer.

# Tamers
Some humans are, as it were, on the same wavelength as a digimon.
Should they ever *meet* that mon, it's quite likely that the pair will hit it off.
With a digivice around, the "bond" becomes more than psychological, and mon and human become connected to a greater degree.
At this point, you have a tamer.

At this point you *also* have the first stage of matrix or spirit evolution.

In any case, one of the signature properties of a tamer is that human emotion and psychology interacts with digimon to facilitate the latter's growth, adding new code based to an often considerable degree on on the thoughts, memories, and emotions in question.
This works even for feral or pure functional digimon, if anything it works *especially* well for them, for the major expansion the mon experiences is *mental*.
Big and strong is just a digimon thing, it's the brain parts that benefit most from a tamer, which admittedly does feed back into strength.

Parenthetically, this is why the Gennais prefer to tap children as tamers.
Not only are the kids more likely to jump at the call to adventure, but they're more likely to have a mindset that lets them grow along with their friends/"mascots" without so many care mistakes.
And care mistakes are a big deal: get it right, that Koromon becomes a legendary world-saving Wargreymon.
Get it wrong, you get a Machinedramon willing to *use* that city-flattening destructive power, or worse.

This connection flows another way: digimon protect their tamers even if that protection couldn't have any physical basis.
If you have a digimon, you gain the toughness needed for feats like riding your Greymon into battle, or even *lifting* Zudomon's hammer much less hammering things with it.

# Non-digimon
Besides digimon and humans, there are several other kinds of thing that aren't just inanimate objects.

## Gennais
These somewhat mysterious entities generally look like humans in some sort of monastic outfit.
While they don't discuss their origins they do freely admit their job is to look after the digital world, balance order and chaos, and so forth.
They don't seem to directly be agents of Yggdrasil, not the way the Royal Knights are.

It is the Gennais that are responsible for the creation of most digivices and summoning humans to become Chosen Ones.
They appear now and then to give people missions or help with an existing mission that's within their purview.
Mostly, however, the Gennais work behind the scenes giving things little nudges and maintaining internal mechanisms of the digiworld.

## Spirits
Spirits are sort of fossils of digimon. Lacking fundamental parts (think "event loop", for instance), they are inert objects unless attached to a human or digimon.
This requires mental compatibility, like canon Agunimon really needs to be used by... well, someone as goggleboy-y as Takuya is.
There's a very basic harness in a spirit's shrine, but it's not really enough for the spirit to *do* much.
Compatibility comes in degrees, the more you have it the better spirit evolution works for you.

## Artifacts
These are more animate than a brick, but don't rise to the level of being a digimon.
Essentially they're the magic items of the digiworld, some require a sort of attunement process to use successfully; some even have a bit of tendency or preference of their own.
There's an upper limit on how autonomous an artifact can be before it becomes a digimon, so if that's not desired the designers generally make it so a more extensive attunement is required.

Basically a mon jacks in and the relevant functions are borrowed by the artifact.
This process works even if the mon has a tamer, or is a spirit tamer in digimon form.

## Livestock
It's not *just* a mon-eat-mon world out there; there are simple plants and animals that produce food and other materials, but which also don't rise to the level of being even a feral digimon.
But if you were expecting there to not be meat plants or salad chickens, you were mistaken, both exist, as do soup mines, rock farms, and refrigerators just sort of standing around in the middle of nowhere inexplicably full of fresh eggs.

# Digital World Geography

Trailmon lines go to some weird places.
There's at least one station in the middle of inky black primordial void, and it's not a terminus.
There's places where the rail "prop" and the lineness don't even pretend to line up.
One station is configured to resemble a (pre bogie-exchange) gauge change station, even though there's no visible reason.

Some of these are required by mathematical theorems underpinning the trailmon network.  
Some are _not_.

Other places... there's very few automobiles.
Most transport is trailmon, artificial trains, riding another mon, or digivolving into something suitable.
Yes, you can hire a private railcar or an entire train.
There's rumours of some kid who got a trailmon partner and found a way for it to rez momentary rails _wherever it likes_
(he has to control this manually, trailmon are surprisingly resistant to the concept of corners).

There's a few cities, though new tamers don't start in one.
Rather more small towns and villages: you'll get tiny villages that are more or less monospecies.
Even random installations like a cafe in the middle of nowhere.
Towns vary a bit more: most have a single trailmon line.

Another cause of random installations and villages is navigable waterways: locks, lifts, and bridges sometimes have a mon looking after them.
Yes, there's boats, sometimes mon-hauled, or you can just ride an aquatic mon if you don't mind getting wet (or have a Submarimon).
You might need a narrowboat to get up some of the thinner canals; it's not the fastest way to get around, but there's sizeable chunks of land with no railway.
This includes a desert where you can also sail in a sandboat and fish for desert-themed digimon.

The digiworld considers euclidean geometry to be for boring people.
The aforementioned desert, for instance, has a canal across it that is quite a bit shorter if you're floating on it.
Indoor spaces have a disconcerting tendency to straight up be in a different worldspace, so subway lines have very different lengths and routes to what you'd expect from station placement.
Heck, there's a forest with a high-rise tree where climbing a ladder into the permanent cloud at the top takes you to someplace quite different (but beware, where it comes out changes without warning).
