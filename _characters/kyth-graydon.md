title: "Graydon Jones"
layout: character
player: "Kyth Coatlmon"
characters:
  - name: Graydon Jones
    class: Spirit tamer
    age: 20
    gender: Male
    appearance: |
      Fairly average-looking human, aside from the dark red hair and silver earrings.

      **Outfit**: Hiking boots, black jeans, dark grey hoodie with a red dragon motif,
      and for some reason a pair of fancy brass goggles.

      Nobody's ever actually seen him wearing them, even at a swimming pool. It looks
      suspiciously like they contain at the least an integrated flashlight.
    evolutions: 
      - level: Rookie
        species: Monodramon
        image: assets/images/digimon/Monodramon.jpg
        description: A purple wyvern digimon. Sadly, it cannot sustain powered flight, barely even a glide.
        abilities:
          - name: Beat Knuckle
            desc: Takes a swipe with its foreclaws

          - name: Crack Bite
            desc: Bite into the target's data, disrupting it (mild poison effect).
          
          - name: Shadow Wing
            desc: Collect force on its wings and direct it forwards as a short-ranged blast.
      
      - level: Champion
        species: Depthmon
        image: assets/images/digimon/Depthmon.jpg
        description: |
          A digimon that has integrated itself with armour specialised for aquatic life.
          Although capable of moving on land, it prefers to swim deep underwater. Even
          depthmon itself is unsure what is under its helmet.

          On land, Depthmon floats just above the ground, a lot like a hovercraft using
          forcefields instead of aerodynamics.
        abilities:
          - name: Bubble Bomb
            desc: Packs explosive force into a bubble that detonates on contact.

          - name: Sargasso Drag
            desc: Conjures ribbons of data that ensnare the target, forcing it to move slowly.
      
      - level: Ultimate
        species: Tylomon
        image: assets/images/digimon/Tylomon.jpg
        description: |
          One of the fastest aquatic digimon. The metal fairing attached to its head is of
          unparalleled hydrodynamic qualities, and bears a serial number from an unknown
          registry. Thanks to improved sensors, it can track its target even at a great range,
          and anticipate motion so as to strike with unerring position.
