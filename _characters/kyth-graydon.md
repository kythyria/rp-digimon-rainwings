  - name: Graydon Jones
    class: Spirit tamer
    age: 20
    gender: Male
    appearance: |
      Fairly average-looking human, aside from the dark red hair and silver earrings.

      **Outfit**: Hiking boots, black jeans, dark grey hoodie with a red dragon motif,
      and for some reason a pair of fancy brass-looking goggles.

      Nobody’s ever actually seen him wearing them, even at a swimming pool. It looks
      suspiciously like they contain at the least an integrated flashlight.

      ## Origin
      You would expect someone that age living in a seaside town to be more inclined
      to actually going near the sea. Graydon somehow managed to largely avoid this,
      being much more fond of keeping both feet on dry land. Well, on solid objects
      above dry land. Er, in the general vicinity, horizontally speaking, of dry
      land, being fond of urban exploration sorts of antics.

      That is, sneaking into places, especially abandoned ones, mostly to look around
      and a little bit for the thrill of evading the authorised personnel. Economics
      and the property market being what they are, very few of the "abandoned" sort
      are on the seafront. Graydon was fine with that, not being a big fan of water.
      The alert reader can probably guess where this is going.

      Specifically, going on to one of the piers. This particular one saw much less traffic,
      due now to being on the fringe of a touristy area–a full discussion of the economic
      history of British seaside towns is out of scope–and so had become down-at-heel, with
      even an entirely unused building or two. Normally he wouldn't give any part of
      the structure the time of day, but losing a bet and not wanting a reputation for
      reneging on agreements, can be a powerful motivator. Perhaps too powerful: early
      in the morning, in a slow week out of season, he slips onto the pier.

      For a moment, he could swear he heard static, or the digitised version of the rushing
      sound when you put a shell to your ear, or perhaps of the overlaid whispers you might
      get in a spooky TV show. Great, he's hearing things.

      Not the most encouraging of things, given he can still look down and realise that all
      that's keeping him from some painful impacts followed by a cold, salty, bath, is a
      single layer of wooden planks, not even fitted so closely as to have no gaps,
      gaps between which he could see the cast-iron support structure and then the ocean below that.
      So by the time he actually got to the building itself,
      some sort of... old cafe?
      He wasn’t sure and the internet wasn’t terribly helpful.
      Anyway,
      by the time he got there,
      Graydon was already more than a bit nervous,
      actively the urge to run back to solid ground.

      Getting in is tricky, the pier is still in use, and his target poses more of a hazard
      than just any old building seeing as if it’s in genuine disrepair it’d be quite
      possible to fall out. He gets in through an upper floor window; those are often
      left open–not that he can usually use this, they’re hard to close after you–and
      in this case the window and frame are old and clearly never closed properly.
      Also it’s close enough to the ocean side as to be downright vertiginious. Not
      from altitude, from what's at the bottom of that altitude, and once actually inside
      he collapsed on the floor panting as much from nerves as exertion. Nerves only made
      worse by that weird sound being back again, like seashell noises being warped into
      a facsimile of a foreign language.

      It’s pretty uninteresting inside save for some old posters from decades ago;
      the historical society might be interested to see these if they don’t ask too
      many questions about how the pictures were obtained, so he snaps away, trusting
      the old roller blinds to dull the light of his phone. Down (ugh) stairs next,
      to the level where if it weren’t for the equally old tiles he’d be constantly
      reminded that the only thing between him and painful impacts or the ocean, or
      both in quick succession, was some wood of varying age and neatness. Brrr.

      The whispering was still going. And it seemed to be coming from below, well below the
      floor level of the pier. 

      Even afterwards, Graydon had no idea what possessed him to actually go looking for the source,
      given that that required he unbolt a door that faced the outside of the pier,
      and descend the stairs. At least they'd been seemingly checked out at the same time as the
      rest of the pier and weren't, like, rotten old boards that would snap under the
      slightest pressure and aaaaaaaaa! After another few minutes peeling himself off the doorframe,
      he essayed a descent.

      The whispers got almost to english words, he thought he could hear something about
      taking up goggles. It seemed to be coming from a mass
      of what looked like barnacles and... mechanical seaweed? That didn't look normal, but
      &ldquo;*I don’t know, I’m not a marine biologist*&rdquo;, he
      thought, &ldquo;*I’ll just grab a few pictures and go back.*&rdquo;.
      
      Or, uh, stick his phone in his pocket, lean over, and poke at the little silver
      statue of a seal nestled in the middle of the clump, hanging as it was from one
      of the cross-ties, and the voice became comprehensible:
      &ldquo;Finally! Someone to work with! You're different, but this should still work!&rdquo;.
      And then everything went strange.

      *Bright turquoise of sunlit sea*, a series of little mechanical sounds.

      *Dull purple*, a string of dolphin chirps like that one display in the aquarium
      that’s as close as he normally gets to the sea.

      *Black* and a presence settling around his mind.

      The next thing Graydon knew, it was... several hours later and he was standing
      on the beach feeling like he’d run a literal marathon after watching a Doctor
      Who marathon? On a beach with no visible footprints in the sand around him, and
      somehow near the tram depot, right at the opposite end of the beach from the
      pier he’d been on. At least he could catch a tram a lot of the way home.

      When he went to fish the transit pass out of his pocket, huh, there was a lump
      in there, bigger than the pass. The little figurine from before, how odd, he
      could swear his fingers had only brushed it before... *that* happened.

      Of course, it wouldn’t be until later he actually learned what that was or what
      it did, or even how it’s supposed to be used...

      - level: Rookie
        species: Hackmon
        image: assets/images/digimon/Hackmon.png
        description: |
          A small, armoured, dragon with goggles, that gives off the impression it should be purple. It
          compensates for its lack of flight by putting comparable amounts of energy into charging foes horn-first,
          when not setting them on fire.
        abilities:
          - name: Pepper Breath
            desc: Spits a ball of fire.
          
          - name: Fifth Rush
            desc: Takes a swipe with its foreclaws
          
          - name: Horn Drill
            desc: Dashes forward, horn lowered to puncture the target.
      
      - level: Champion
        species: Depthmon
        image: assets/images/digimon/Depthmon.jpg
        description: |
          A digimon that has integrated itself with armour specialised for aquatic life.
          Although capable of moving on land, it prefers to swim deep underwater. Even
          depthmon itself is unsure what is under its helmet.

          On land, Depthmon floats just above the ground, a lot like a hovercraft using
          forcefields instead of aerodynamics.
        abilities:
          - name: Bubble Bomb
            desc: Packs explosive force into a bubble that detonates on contact.

          - name: Sargasso Drag
            desc: Conjures ribbons of data that ensnare the target, forcing it to move slowly.
      
      - level: Perfect (candidate)
        species: Regalecusmon
        image: assets/images/digimon/Regalecusmon.jpg
        description: |
          A submarine chimera, the result of a complete redesign to incorporate Zudomon's horn
          and a freshly developed pincer. It found out what was under Depthmon's helmet, and
          decided the best thing to do was to replace that with piscine data, plus a new, more
          bitey, helm, in case of headbutts or chomps.
        abilities:
          - name: Briona Strike
            desc: Charges its sword with electricity, and makes a piercing strike.
          
          - name: Corona Discharge
            desc: Forms an explosive ball of plasma in its pincer, then deliberately fails containment, damaging everything around it.
          
          - name: Surf
            desc: Summons a wave or current to ride on.
        
      - level: Perfect (candidate)
        species: Gusokumon
        image: assets/images/digimon/Gusokumon.jpg
        description: |
          A highly evolved crustacean, adapted to withstand even the greatest of pressure in the darkest of depths.
          Due to the weight of the structural reinforcement required to not implode, and the muscles needed to lift that,
          it's no great speedster, but instead quite implacable, shrugging off rather than dodging attacks as it approaches
          with seemingly bottomless stamina.
        abilities:
          - name: Colony Torpedo
            desc: Fires a fish-like weapon that relentlessly homes in on its target to deliver a powerful explosion.

          - name: Pelagic Mire
            desc: Engulfs the target in a geyser of heavy mud.

          - name: Corona Discharge
            desc: Forms an explosive ball of plasma in its pincer, then deliberately fails containment, damaging everything around it.

      #- level: Ultimate
      #  species: Tylomon
      #  image: assets/images/digimon/Tylomon.jpg
      #  description: |
      #    One of the fastest aquatic digimon. The metal fairing attached to its head is of
      #    unparalleled hydrodynamic qualities, and bears a serial number from an unknown
      #    registry. Thanks to improved sensors, it can track its target even at a great range,
      #    and anticipate motion so as to strike with unerring precision.
      #  abilities:
      #    - name: Torpedo Attack
      #      desc: Fires a homing torpedo, or uses itself as the torpedo
      #
      #    - name: Terror Plankton
      #      desc: Fires a jet of water laced with abrasive, poisonous, plankton
      #    
      #    - name: Surf
      #      desc: Summons a wave or current to ride on
      
      - level: Mega
        species: Metalseadramon
        image: assets/images/digimon/Metalseadramon.png
        description: |
          The laser-nosed, chrome-digizoid-armoured titan of the seas. The term "sea serpent"
          barely does this behemoth justice, every inch of it armoured or made of straight up
          living metal with the toughness of armour and the flexibiity of serpent hide.

          This is the apex of aquatic digimon, armed, armoured, and equipped with muscles and
          thruster units of such immense strength that neither crushing depths nor rarefied
          atmosphere poses an obstacle. Nor do many solid objects; that really is a rather
          large laser.
        abilities:
          - name: River of Power
            desc: You see that giant laser cannon? Yeah.

          - name: Poseidon Divide
            desc: Summons a huge wave to flatten/wash away enemies
          
          - name: Surf
            desc: Summons a huge wave for transportation purposes
