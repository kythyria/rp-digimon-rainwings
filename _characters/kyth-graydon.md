  - name: Graydon Jones
    class: Spirit tamer
    age: 20
    gender: Male
    appearance: |
      Fairly average-looking human, aside from the dark red hair and silver earrings.

      **Outfit**: Hiking boots, black jeans, dark grey hoodie with a red dragon motif,
      and for some reason a pair of fancy brass-looking goggles.

      Nobody's ever actually seen him wearing them, even at a swimming pool. It looks
      suspiciously like they contain at the least an integrated flashlight.

      ## Origin
      You would expect someone that age living in a seaside town to be more inclined
      to actually going near the sea. Graydon somehow managed to largely avoid this,
      being much more fond of keeping both feet on dry land. Well, on solid objects
      above dry land. Er, in the general vicinity, horizontally speaking, of dry
      land, being fond of urban exploration sorts of antics.

      That is, sneaking into places, especially abandoned ones, mostly to look around
      and a little bit for the thrill of evading the authorised personnel. Economics
      and the property market being what they are, very few of the "abandoned" sort
      are on the seafront. Graydon was fine with that, not being a big fan of water.
      The alert reader can probably guess where this is going.

      Specifically, losing a bet and getting dared into investigating one that is. To
      wit, a building on one of the piers. It hadn't been used in a while and he'd
      hardly given it the time of day before, looking down and seeing water and cast
      iron between the gaps in the planking wasn't his idea of a good time. But a bet
      is a bet, and when nobody's looking–early in the morning in a slow week–he slips
      onto the pier.

      Getting in is tricky, the pier is still in use, and poses more of a hazard
      than just any old building seeing as if it's in genuine disrepair it'd be quite
      possible to fall out. He gets in through an upper floor window; those are often
      left open–not that he can usually use this, they're hard to close after you–and
      in this case the window and frame are old and clearly never closed properly.
      Also it's close enough to the ocean side as to induce actual vertigo and nearly
      collapsing onto the floor inside.

      It's pretty uninteresting inside save for some old posters from decades ago;
      the historical society might be interested to see these if they don't ask too
      many questions about how the pictures were obtained, so he snaps away, trusting
      the old roller blinds to dull the light of his phone. Down (ugh) stairs next,
      to the level where if it weren't for the equally old tiles he'd be constantly
      reminded that the only thing between him and painful impacts or the ocean, or
      both in quick succession, was some wood of varying age and neatness. Brrr.

      Even afterwards, Graydon had no idea what possessed him to unbolt the door on
      the ocean side and take the old stairs, some of them worryingly old looking and,
      lower down, slimy from spray.

      Maybe he'd seen the glint on one of the supports earlier on? Certainly the mass
      of what looked like barnacles and... mechanical seaweed? wasn't right, nor was
      its faint luminescence. "*I don't know, I'm not a marine biologist*", he
      thought, "I'll just grab a few pictures and go back.".
      
      Or, uh, stick his phone in his pocket, lean over, and poke at the little silver
      statue of a seal nestled in the middle of the clump, hanging as it was from one
      of the cross-ties, and then everything went strange.

      *Bright turquoise of sunlit sea*, a series of little mechanical sounds

      *Dull purple*, a string of dolphin chirps like that one display in the aquarium
      that's as close as he normally gets to the sea.

      *Black* and a presence settling around his mind.

      The next thing Graydon knew, it was... several hours later and he was standing
      on the beach feeling like he'd run a literal marathon after watching a Doctor
      Who marathon? On a beach with no visible footprints in the sand around him, and
      somehow near the tram depot, right at the opposite end of the beach from the
      pier he'd been on. At least he could catch a tram a lot of the way home.

      When he went to fish the transit pass out of his pocket, huh, there was a lump
      in there, bigger than the pass. The little figurine from before, how odd, he
      could swear his fingers had only brushed it before... *that* happened.

      Of course, it wouldn't be until later he actually learned what that was or what
      it did, or even how it's supposed to be used...

    evolutions: 
      - level: Rookie
        species: Monodramon
        image: assets/images/digimon/Monodramon.jpg
        description: A purple wyvern digimon. Sadly, it cannot sustain powered flight, barely even a glide.
        abilities:
          - name: Beat Knuckle
            desc: Takes a swipe with its foreclaws

          - name: Crack Bite
            desc: Bite into the target's data, disrupting it (mild poison effect).
          
          - name: Shadow Wing
            desc: Collect force on its wings and direct it forwards as a short-ranged blast.
      
      - level: Champion
        species: Depthmon
        image: assets/images/digimon/Depthmon.jpg
        description: |
          A digimon that has integrated itself with armour specialised for aquatic life.
          Although capable of moving on land, it prefers to swim deep underwater. Even
          depthmon itself is unsure what is under its helmet.

          On land, Depthmon floats just above the ground, a lot like a hovercraft using
          forcefields instead of aerodynamics.
        abilities:
          - name: Bubble Bomb
            desc: Packs explosive force into a bubble that detonates on contact.

          - name: Sargasso Drag
            desc: Conjures ribbons of data that ensnare the target, forcing it to move slowly.
      
      - level: Ultimate
        species: Tylomon
        image: assets/images/digimon/Tylomon.jpg
        description: |
          One of the fastest aquatic digimon. The metal fairing attached to its head is of
          unparalleled hydrodynamic qualities, and bears a serial number from an unknown
          registry. Thanks to improved sensors, it can track its target even at a great range,
          and anticipate motion so as to strike with unerring position.
      
      - level: Mega
        species: Metalseadramon
        image: assets/images/digimon/Metalseadramon.png
        description: |
          The laser-nosed, chrome-digizoid-armoured titan of the seas. The term "sea serpent"
          barely does this behemoth justice, every inch of it armoured or made of straight up
          living metal with the toughness of armour and the flexibiity of serpent hide.

          This is the apex of aquatic digimon, armed, armoured, and equipped with muscles and
          thruster units of such immense strength that neither crushing depths nor rarefied
          atmosphere poses an obstacle. Nor do many solid objects; that really is a rather
          large laser.
        abilities:
          - name: River of Power
            desc: IMMA FIRING MY LAZOR! SHOOP DA WOOOOOP!
