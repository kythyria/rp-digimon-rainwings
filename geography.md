Trailmon lines go to some weird places.
There's at least one station in the middle of inky black primordial void, and it's not a terminus.
There's places where the rail "prop" and the lineness don't even pretend to line up.
One station is configured to resemble a (pre bogie-exchange) gauge change station, even though there's no visible reason.

Some of these are required by mathematical theorems underpinning the trailmon network.  
Some are _not_.

Other places... there's very few automobiles.
Most transport is trailmon, artificial trains, riding another mon, or digivolving into something suitable.
Yes, you can hire a private railcar or an entire train.
There's rumours of some kid who got a trailmon partner and found a way for it to rez momentary rails _wherever it likes_
(he has to control this manually, trailmon are surprisingly resistant to the concept of corners).

There's a few cities, though new tamers don't start in one.
Rather more small towns and villages: you'll get tiny villages that are more or less monospecies.
Even random installations like a cafe in the middle of nowhere.
Towns vary a bit more: most have a single trailmon line.

Another cause of random installations and villages is navigable waterways: locks, lifts, and bridges sometimes have a mon looking after them.
Yes, there's boats, sometimes mon-hauled, or you can just ride an aquatic mon if you don't mind getting wet (or have a Submarimon).
You might need a narrowboat to get up some of the thinner canals; it's not the fastest way to get around, but there's sizeable chunks of land with no railway.
This includes a desert where you can also sail in a sandboat and fish for desert-themed digimon.

The digiworld considers euclidean geometry to be for boring people.
The aforementioned desert, for instance, has a canal across it that is quite a bit shorter if you're floating on it.
Indoor spaces have a disconcerting tendency to straight up be in a different worldspace, so subway lines have very different lengths and routes to what you'd expect from station placement.
Heck, there's a forest with a high-rise tree where climbing a ladder into the permanent cloud at the top takes you to someplace quite different (but beware, where it comes out changes without warning).

# Biomes
For lack of a better term, we will call them this.
There are a handful of these:

## Desert
Sand, heat, and dryness.
Clear skies, day and night, and it never really cools. 
Pteramon despise this biome, fire-themed digimon tend to love it.
In some deserts, there may be flat, dense, almost gravelly sand with vast patterns formed out of differences in the colour, while others are shifting dunes.

## Forest
There's a few kinds of these, but you can certainly see the wood here.
It's in the trees.
Lots of trees.

The main type is a medium-density deciduous wood: the ground is grassy, and space under the trees filled in with bushes.
Clearings and watercourses are reasonably common, and the occasional macadamised road (small stones, packed tightly into their own dust).

You can travel by trailmon here, but beware of leaves on the line.

## Grassland
What you get if you take forest and replace most of the trees with more grass.
There's a bit less surface water than forest, but not much.
Towns sprawl their outskirts and farms out into grassland more enthusiastically than other biomes, and herds of grazing digimon and livestock wander.

## Icy
Trees here are coniferous, if present.
Regardless of the weather, there's snow on the ground, probably because, much like how deserts never cool, this biome never *thaws*.
Only a few rivers are open water, everything else is frozen over.
Architecture here tends to be made out of ice too, and snow-coloured, like the inhabitants, mainly snow or ice themed digimon.
Meanwhile, the trailmon lines are elevated or else in their own little tunnels made of ice or carved into rocky overhangs.

There's only one thing worse to a trailmon than leaves on the line, and that's the wrong kind of snow.

## Ocean
What is there to say about the ocean?
It's big, wet, and full of fish.
But in the digiworld, it's full of sea monsters as well.
Get diving gear, a digivolution of the Deep Savers field, or hire a submarimon, because the reefs are gorgeous, and there's a surprising number of shipwrecks.

Shipwrecks. Everything from pirate galleons to entire alien spaceships and everything in between.
Haunted, stuffed with treasure, or just home to a lot of fish.

There's in-use constructions down here too: tunnels for trailmon (buried or transparent), telegraph cables, pipelines, and even weirder things.
Huge mystic sigils cast in concrete, gantries supporting arrays of curious transducers, submarimon docks not attached to anything visible, that sort of thing.

## Machine
There's urban, and then there's *this*.
It's not just built-up, it's been built up, and dug down, and under the care of Metal Empire mons for so long, or for such grand purpose, that it's one vast industrial facility.

No nature here, save for what weeds grow through the cracks in an abandoned area, just endless metal and concrete, and no respect for ground level, if a machine is tall it might be installed in a pit to make the top easier to reach.

## Sky
Yes, this is a biome.
There's a difference between being in the sky and being in a Sky biome though, and it is this: the "real" ground is completely irrelevant.

It's a big sky, big enough you can't even see the ground from the upper reaches, and sparsely occupied by flying digimon.
At great intervals, however, there *is* something besides digimon: islands (of whichever biome) hovering in midair like they've repealed the law of gravity, and flying installations abandoned by their original builders.

Some of these are huge castles, overgrown with immense plants and in varying degrees of ruination under that.
Others are essentially machine or urban biomes as manifested in the sky, built around endoskeletons of immense girders and well-hidden engine pods.
Also in varying degrees of decay, usually.

Some are inhabited by digimon who use them mainly to hold up nests and perches and generally don't see sturdy walkways as necessary.
Inhabited or not, though, it's not all that unusual to find some ancient machine digimon lurking, usually long-since deactivated, but here and there are ones dormant awaiting some unspecified condition.
A few are not only still functional but actually operational, maintaining their installations.

## Dark
This is the only name digimon geographers have been able to agree on for this biome, and at that it might be a quirk of translation.
The reason is clear, though: it never gets above twilight here, even when you need sunglasses everywhere else.
The effect is rather dramatic, it's like a cosmic sunshade hovers over the entire biome.

The inhabitants, terrain, and generally everything are a mixed bag, this is where a lot of dark or malice themed digimon live, of course.
That doesn't mean they *are* malicious; many are actually much nicer if encountered here than elsehwere.

# Wildlands
Not all of the digital world is easygoing.
For various reasons, including the distribution of naturally occurring livestock and other resources, not everywhere is a mix of remote but easily settleable hinterland and bustling towns.

Some is dead, inhabited by nothing at all save ruins or the most intentionally remote installations.

Wildlands are not this.
Wildlands are places where the terrain itself is outright harsh, and the inhabitants harsher.
Many an unprepared digimon, and even human, has perished in the wildlands, victim of the dangerous environment or even their own psyche.

Adventurers who are already toughened up mentally as well as physically can survive pretty well, if they don't mind their own teeth and claws getting a red tinge.

## Wild Jungles
Beauty that can surpass even what one can witness back in the human world, hiding terrifying creatures that are more than willing to fight to the death for the smallest scraps of prey.
The creatures found in areas of thick foliage where no civilization is found are usually in the deep end of feralism, sometimes not even the best Data Squad tamer can bring them to their side.
Even one who succeeds would find they have to do nearly all the thinking for their mon, training it to follow commands and to blunt the sharp corners of instinct into something useful, unlike the initiative-taking partners most tamers have.

In these jungles, it is a digimon-eats-digimon world, where the strong rule and the weak perish, becoming substenance for the winner.
In a more grotesque display of animalistic behavior, some digimon outright tear off parts of their prey in order to fasten the rate by which a digimon decomposes into smaller bits, which can be quite graphic for those unprepared.
However, there exist rather primitive villages composed of digimon that are barely conscious, and while they may be able to communicate discretion is still advised.

## Wild Deserts
When one thinks of deserts, death, decay and drought are usually what comes to mind, yet the digital version of such places couldn’t be far from the truth.
In such extreme climates, the hunt is as dangerous as anywhere else, digimon and tamers alike venturing in this sea of sand in order to fish for creatures that swim through the scorching desert.

Small oases can be artificially created, settlements exist where richness and abundance seemingly contradict the “death” of their surroundings, where nothing should ever grow.
Thus, being lost in the desert might not be a death sentence, as long as you don’t encounter things as equally lucky as you, if not a bit more.
There are even some weird occurrences when, in the middle of the desert, one can find things like fridges or other electro domestics lying around with seemingly no way of ever reaching that place, and definitely not being powered up by anything, yet functioning as if they were.

So salvation might come to the straggler, in the form of a cold one-or several ones, well, as long as it is not something that’s been deliberately put there. It is said that there’s an underground channel, a collection of tunnels dug by digimon that usually lead to either someplace where there’s food or even to civilization. Be careful, however, as these digimon do not seek those places to do trade exactly, and you might end up having to fend off against giant beasts that lurk in these dark tunnels.

## Wild Sky
It's nearly impossible to tell, but actually most of the Sky *is* wild, it's just not very populated.
Much of the hazard is thunderstorms and incredible turbulence... and then you get to truly wild installations.

These might be islands which themselves are wildlands, or they might be more purposefully constructed.
That the latter sort sometimes turns up out of nowhere, relatively close to the ground, is a constant source of work for adventurers, for they might be tame... or might not be.
