title: Matters cosmic
---
We all know of Yggdrasil, the manifestation/personification of the metaphysical machinery that keeps the digiworld running.
The kernel, as it were. And indeed, it is, with the Royal Knights as its agents to make sure the digiworld stays in one piece.
It doesn't show its hand that often, only for the largest-scale threats (albeit that the definition is occasionally opaque).

However, it's not the only entity charged with cosmic responsibility on that scale, it has a "counterpart", Apocalymon.
Where Yggdrasil's job is to keep the digiworld running, Apocalymon is part of a failsafe system to prevent the digital
world from collapsing entirely.

Such as when adventurers, the Royal Knights, Demon Lords, and regular lowercase-D digidestined have been unsuccessful.

Usually it's hidden in the digiworld's sun.
When the sun goes dark, that's because the solar processes have shut down normal operations to allow Apocalymon to take over.
When activated, Apocalymon's job is to scour the digiworld for important data, such as the contents of Primary Village,
the mons that take care of same, templates for and chunks of intact landscape, and so forth, and store them within itself.
Having done this, it attempts to recover the digiworld.

In particular, Kuramon are spawned to consume corrupted data (one of the few digimon which can do so safely at scale).
They generally wind up eating a lot else of the digiworld, but that's sort of the point.

If this stage malfunctions, Arcadiamon is spawned to knock some sense into it.
If _that_ don't work, capital-D Digidestined are summoned to knock some sense into the two of them.
Either way, at the end of this the digiworld is mostly just itty bits of rubble floating in the void, and Arcadiamon
either deletes itself or is defeated thoroughly by the Digidestined.

And then, the stage is set for Apocalymon to initiate the final stages of recovery, clearing away even that so it can restore
the digiworld from the backups it took shortly after the sun went dark.

Because they get front-row seats to a lot of this, it tends to stick in the minds of any babies that happen to live through
the process. Guess where a whole bunch of legends come from, including the ones about capital-D Digidestined?

Summoning humans to be capital-D Digidestined is an option at several stages, usually to, as it were, troubleshoot,
somewhat in both senses of the word but mostly in the sense of finding trouble and shooting it.
There are a number of places where this happens: if arcadimon gets messed up, if a digidestined happens to have Alphamon's
"slap sense into Yggdrasil" power or the equivalent for Apocalymon, or if Apocalymon has stashed the important stuff but
thinks it it's worth troubleshooting in the perpetual half-suspended twilight left behind.

The Demon Lords are agents of Apocalymon, much as the Royal Knights are Yggdrasil's. It can dispatch them without fully waking up itself.
One of their functions is specifically to be a way for the Digidestined to level grind, and possibly to use drastic,
villainous methods that Yggdrasil would not (if you're wondering where the OOMkiller went, probably into a Demon Lord).
Homeostasis, meanwhile, is a monitoring subsystem. Its job is to detect when to escalate to the next level of failsafe,
or to make Digidestined to kick some sense into the other subsystems or indeed itself.

Homeostasis actually has the ability to restore chunks of the digiworld from backup, which mostly it uses to repair localised
damage, but in theory could use as a last-ditch, scorched earth, strategy to recover from a really outside-context failure.

To some extent Digidestined have the same blessing as Royal Knights, Demon Lords, and so forth.
How much depends on the severity of the problem, from barely earning the capital letter to being buffed enough
to beat up an Arcadiamon fat from eating an Armageddemon that ate the digiworld.

Yggdrasil, Homeostasis, Apocalymon, and a few other less obvious things aren't digimon, existing on a level too
fundamental for the concept of digimon to exist yet.
Apocalymon is only sort of a digimon, it's one of those entities wearing a digimon suit
(which is possibly how the humanoid bit can appear at Sky-hop occasionally).
And Alphamon's job is partly to slap sense into Yggdrasil if needed (there's an equivalent for Apocalymon but nobody's ever seen it).
Oddly enough, sometimes a digidestined of any capitalness can get either of those blessings, if the blessing is needed and
a digidestined is around to receive it.
