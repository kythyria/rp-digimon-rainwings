title: Matters cosmic
---
We all know of Yggdrasil, the manifestation/personification of the metaphysical machinery that keeps the digiworld running.
The kernel, as it were. And indeed, it is, with the Royal Knights as its agents to make sure the digiworld stays in one piece.
It doesn't show its hand that often, only for the largest-scale threats (albeit that the definition is occasionally opaque).

However, it's not the only entity charged with cosmic responsibility on that scale, it has a "counterpart", Apocalymon.
Where Yggdrasil's job is to keep the digiworld running, Apocalymon is the last in a chain of failsafes to prevent the
digiworld collapsing disastrously.
Before then the failsafe system tries to:
1. send Royal Knights
2. make capital-D Digidestined
3. spawn Armageddemon,
4. spawn Arcadiamon,
and only if all of these fail does Apocalymon step in.

Usually it's hidden in the digiworld's sun.
When the sun goes dark, that's because the solar processes have shut down normal operations to allow Apocalymon to take over.
When activated, Apocalymon's job is to scour the digiworld for important data, such as the contents of Primary Village,
the mons that take care of same, templates for and chunks of intact landscape, and so forth, and store them within itself.
Having done this, it intiates another round of spawning Kuramon or a D-Reaper to delete the doomed digiworld, while
Apocalymon itself curls up tightly, waiting for the destruction to pass, whereupon it clears the void out and reassembles
a digiworld from the pieces.

Because they get front-row seats to a lot of this, it tends to stick in the minds of any babies that happen to live through
the process. Guess where a whole bunch of legends come from.

The Demon Lords are agents of Apocalymon, much as the Royal Knights are Yggdrasil's. It can dispatch them without waking up itself.
One of their functions is specifically to be a way for the Digidestined to level grind, and possibly to use drastic,
villainous methods that Yggdrasil would not (if you're wondering where the OOMkiller went, probably into a Demon Lord).
Homeostasis, meanwhile, is a monitoring subsystem. Its job is to detect when to escalate to the next level of failsafe,
or to make Digidestined to kick some sense into the other subsystems or indeed itself.

Yggdrasil, Homeostasis, Apocalymon, and a few other less obvious things aren't digimon, existing on a level too
fundamental for the concept of digimon to exist yet.
Apocalymon is only sort of a digimon, it's one of those entities wearing a digimon suit
(which is possibly how the humanoid bit can appear at Sky-hop occasionally).
