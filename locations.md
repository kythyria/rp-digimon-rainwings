# Lovelace, the starting town

Aside from the train station that dominates the skyline, a strange sight will greet you. 
Buildings meshed together with nether rhyme nor reason, neon signs that look futuristic pointing at houses and small business that are as rural as you might imagine, or buildings made out of wood and stone that combined form a strange and almost chaotic form of symmetry that makes no sense-yet does at the same time.
Some of these buildings have doors that only a kid and a digimon can pass through without much problem, leaving theories as to what-or who might have constructed this place in the minds of adults that might need to crouch uncomfortably to get inside. 
Statues and decorations constructed with the most random items you could ever think of pointing at different locations, growing in strangeness the further you walk from the center of this bizarre town. 
Strangely, the road will simply cut off into wilderness, not even a trail of rocks follows and venturing around the surface might end up with you getting attacked by rookie-level digimon that are a bit too feral to care about dealing with whatever problem they have with you through dialogie.

## The Station
Oh yes, speaking of the station.

The very first place humans are likely to see is the Station, usually by accident: it's easy to just warp into the station accidentally, because reality is so thin there and train stations exist in order to travel anyway. But if you're on the platforms it's still a U-shaped Victorian neo-gothic edifice, all red brick and slightly pointy or perfectly circular arches and window frames with sandstone accents. Then between the arms soars an enormous, also slightly pointy, cast iron and rivet frame holding up a mostly glass roof and the huge floodlamps that light the space at night. They're clearly not lamps of human manufacture, involving crystals and lenses, but still lamps.

It's hard to tell from inside, but the platforms are on the second floor. While you could go through the big arch at the front front (as big digimon often do), most travellers go down the stairs onto the main concourse, at first glance like any other terminus concourse: the ticket offices, shops catering to travellers in a hurry, departure boards, all that jazz. But most of the text is digimoji, and the travellers are mostly digimon. Indeed, the relatively low ceilings of the concourse must be cramped for some of the bigger ones. If you don't get sidetracked by the stairs down to the *other* platforms, lunch, or the warren of corridors that the ends of the main concourse degenerate into, you can walk out the side doors into the town proper.

Oh, and at night the station changes quite a bit. The trains have wildly different livery matching the different trailmon drawing them, fair enough. But downstairs is a different matter. The lights change their spectrum, yellowing noticeably. There are alleyways where there weren't alleyways before *inside* the station, and different shops are open. If you look closely, some of them were clearly hiding behind a hologram during the day. And much shadier types walk around much more openly, or are behind the counter of the shops, or even just in the less well-lit corridors with little stalls or just a longcoat with pockets. The merchandise is correspondingly... not something you'd buy in broad daylight, or always well described: caveat emptor is in full force at this time.

## Data Squad Outpost
As you reach outside, the sea of digimon will no doubt confuse the majority of arrivals, that is until you veer your head to the closest building from the station’s exit: what appears to be a small police booth not far from you.
Entering it will greet you with a bunch of creatures and humans alike walking about, albeit the first wearing what could only be described as multicolored track suits with a rather oddly-designed jacket atop of it.
The initials DS engraved somewhere on this strange, and rather tacky, uniform.
Those who venture here first might be informed of the situation they are in, and how important it is for them to learn the purpose of their visit.
After all, danger is always present in the digiworld, especially if you brought no lil’ monster to accompany you.

## Burgamon Bar
The aroma of food might draw in those with a palate for bread and potatoes, not far from it being a first encounter with the most peculiar digimon business: A fast food restaurant that specializes in burgers, French fries and fruit juice-Why not soda you ask?
They will most likely look at you dumbfounded and ask you if this “soda” you speak of is a friend of yours.
However, just by looking at the staff might give you an idea as to the source of their confusion: Digimon themed after hamburgers and potatoes – Burgermon and Potamon.
The strangest thing about this is the fact that they do not seek financial compensation for their services, and are more than happy to just watch others eat their cooking. 
Where they get the ingredients for their non-profit expedition into the culinary arts is a mystery even for some of the older residents, but the majority have learned to deal with it.
I mean, who doesn’t like free burgers?

## The Gym
And as if to mock those that come for an unhealthy meal, the store in front of it, rather than food, sells a lifestyle.
A dojo specialized in digimon is not shy on showing its customers training and fighting machines that would otherwise kill a human.
Perhaps one of the few doors where a person might not need to crouch allows the entering to this world of rugged, large digimon and small alike, pumping iron, punching bags of sand and some rather extreme forms of exercises like literally detonating a bomb on themselves as part of a normal, physical endurance regime.
Of course, registering and paying a fee might come as a surprise after the free banquet, but for those looking for strength it might be a small price to pay for strength.

## The clinic
However, those that venture untrained, without having challenged the gym or with a digimon that might find itself countered by the local digimon, might find themselves in a small clinic of a single floor being attended by a sistermon and an angemon, who are quite knowledgeable in treating not only digimon, but even humans that might’ve found themselves in the crossfire.
Perhaps knowledge imparted to them by the DS, or from their previous tamer, although being asked that often proves foolish as they’ll either ignore it or give a different answer each time.

There exists other places that specifically exchange money for services, but these are to be found by anyone curious enough.
