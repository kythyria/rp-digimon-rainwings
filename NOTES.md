> K: You need a way in (or out, if you're a digimon) of the digiworld. Takes a strong will to pry it open if it's not already open?

Part of criteria for "promising" is jumping at the call.

If there's more openness between the worlds rather than just chosen heroes/villains crossing over, the Gennais are very much the mon counterpart of the Data Squad. Even if they aren't, really: the Gennais cast the "Summon Everyman Hero"... but the DS cast "Summon Every*mon* Hero". In the more open world, Gennais are responsible for humans that end up in the digiworld, and the DS vice versa.

> S: So if a human wants to go to the digital world, they don't go as tamer but rather AS the "digimon" via the spirits?

Main character types
* spirit tamer
* solo mon
* perhaps easier than 01 tamer to integrate into this, is matrix tamer: like a spirit tamer but you have a regular mon instead of a spirit

Like a mon in the human world, humans in the digiworld are at a disadvantage just by being human. Being at least part time mon is one way around this, and besides, if you resonate with a mon or a spirit enough to be a tamer you're halfway to matrix or spirit evolution.

Also possible:
> S: Then how about going the Nintendo DS route and have it be an internet hub accessed via the tamagochi toy? Like they are these expensive "keys" to the digital world that grant you a single egg from which a digimon can be born. There, humans can either go the tamer route or use spirits, while digimon can go solo and go full adventure mode.

Tamers are inherently matrix or spirit tamers: Being a tamer at all, having a digivice, connects you to the mon and that's the first stage of that evolution type. Hence why in Colon Joe can use Zudomon's hammer. But this has another side: digimon grow *differently* when they have a tamer.

But with a human wrangling them, that human's interactions tend to add new code. In short, digimon are *very* impressionable, and it changes their very being.

> S: I mean there's a bunch of mons that are basically feral, now imagine human interaction as adding "code" to said program with the human showing them kindness and love, or hatred and pain, and the mon is basically a sponge that expands their range of utilities not necessarily power-wise, but mental wise. That's why care mistakes are live-or-death vital to a digimon, you are basically imprinting them with code as an user.  
> ...You know, perhaps that's another reason human children are chosen rather than adults.  
> They kind of both grow together, and it's easier for children to think of digimon as their "beloved mascots/friends"
> Ergo, reducing any occurrence of care mistakes that could turn the legendary Greymon supposed to save the world into a Machinedramon with the power of G O D

There's an obvious source of villains in this, a manipulative mon glomming on to a human to get the boost (bit of a gamble, if your human turns out to be virtuous rather than corruptible you run the risk of becoming a goody-two-shoes yourself) and then going all you have outlived your usefulness. The matrix of what's a care mistake is different for such a mon, too. Possibly these sorts of mons try to organise it based on one party "hiring" the other.

Crests are a thing, the reason you don't see ones based on negative traits is because the gennais and DS both tend to bury that. The math implies the existence of, say, a rage crest, because crests exist at all, but nobody except card carrying villains wants the kind of mon or tamer that's compatible with that running around. 

If we went to the human world there's kind of three groups:
> 1. Chosen Children who resonated with digimon hard enough to be yeeted into the digital world
> 2. People working for DS who were given a specialized digivices and a digimon egg to take care of. Might not grow as strong as the former but are better trained than the chosen ones
> 3. High-end criminal organization that are salivating at the prospect of the cheapest nukes known to man

This isn't a straight-up thing, you won't see 2 or 3 much until stuff gets high-powered.
DS might actually be ok with chosen children once the compatibility of goals is shown.
The ~~Payday Gang~~ ~~Team Rocket~~ Yakuza (or whoever) are, of course, villains.
Murder, extortion, and robbery and that's *before* they get digimon.
DS want to maintain the masquerade pretty hard, they really don't want any more criminals aware of digimon (or the public really, PR headache).

Chosen Children or Digimon (need a name for those) thus have to keep under the radar themselves when in the human world.

One of the ways you can get into the digiworld is by travelling, and taking an unusual diversion.
In particular, you might find yourself with a special train ticket that... well, depending on where you use it the station might grow an extra platform, or just going through the ticket barrier takes you to a different place.
At that extra platform is, of course, a trailmon or several, or in some cases the gear to spirit evolve *into* a trailmon.
Travel from there is straightforward.

But train stations are inherently liminal, and liminality can weaken the walls of reality, so sometimes things cross over without such formality.
Vendors selling tickets.
Suspicious beings selling things that the authorities, any authorities, would frown on.
Yourself.
This can get pretty dramatic, at the shadier places and times an uncomfortable-looking and chained digimon won't raise eyebrows.
Possibly you bought that mon from a shady dude who sold you what looked like a 2000s cellphone and the "pet" came part of the package.
At other times all you'll notice is that the merchandise in the shops is different.
Especially if you were in somewhere like St Pancras that has an outright expy in the digiworld.

Applimon are just another sort of digimon based on different data.

One can either play as a human with a partner digimon, a regular human with spirit jogressing or a lonesome digimon that acts as a self-employed adventurer.

(Things for first town)
As you reach outside, the sea of digimon will no doubt confuse the majority of arrivals, that is until you veer your head to the closes building from the station’s exit: what appears to be a small police booth not far from you. Entering it will greet you with a bunch of creatures and humans alike walking about, albeit the first wearing what could only be described as multicolored track suits with a rather oddly-designed jacket atop of it. The initials DS engraved somewhere on this strange, and rather tacky, uniform. Those who venture here first might be informed of the situation they are in, and how important it is for them to learn the purpose of their visit. After all, danger is always present in the digiworld, especially if you brought no lil’ monster to accompany you.

The aroma of food might draw in those with a palate for bread and potatoes, not far from it being a first encounter with the most peculiar digimon business: A fast food restaurant that specializes in burgers, French fries and fruit juice-Why not soda you ask? They will most likely look at you dumbfounded and ask you if this “soda” you speak of is a friend of yours. However, just by looking at the staff might give you an idea as to the source of their confusion: Digimon themed after hamburgers and potatoes – Burgermon and Potamon. The strangest thing about this is the fact that they do not seek financial compensation for their services, and are more than happy to just watch others eat their cooking. Where they get the ingredients for their non-profit expedition into the culinary arts is a mystery even for some of the older residents, but majority have learned to deal with it. I mean, who doesn’t like free burgers?

And as if to mock those that come for an unhealthy meal, the store in front of it rather than food, sells a lifestyle. A dojo specialized in digimon is not shy on showing its customers training and fighting machines that would otherwise kill a human. Perhaps one of the few doors where a person might not need to crouch allows the entering to this world of rugged, large digimon and small alike, pumping iron, punching bags of sand and some rather extreme forms of exercises like literally detonating a bomb on themselves as part of a normal, physical endurance regime. Of course, registering and paying a fee might come as a surprise after the free banquet, but for those looking for strength it might be a small price to pay for strength. 
However, those that venture untrained, without having challenged the gym or with a digimon that might find itself countered by the local digimon, might find themselves in a small clinic of a single floor being attended by a sistermon and an angemon, who are quite knowledgeable in treating not only digimon, but even humans that might’ve found themselves in the crossfire. Perhaps knowledge imparted to them by the DS, or from their previous tamer, although being asked that often proves foolish as they’ll either ignore it or give a different answer every time. 

Now with the amount of carnivorous digimon and the fact that there’s an actual, real preference for meat discussed quite frequently by beasts thrice your size, you’d think you were in the menu. Apparently the laws of biology and physics are ignored and as if by some kind of joke meat DOES grow from the earth, their taste being actually quite richer from the ones back at your place. And while buying and selling them is a thing, the farmers usually are friendly enough to give you a few chunks of meat for you to share with your digimon. After all, they claim to have been helped by quite a few so-called gentlemen back in the past, although what that word means is lost to them. The older of the bunch will probably ask you if gentleman is just an evolution after human, much to the humor of most.

There exists other places that specifically exchange money for services, but these are to be found by anyone curious enough.

## Rules of Engagement
-	Respect. There’s something to be said between lightly joking and being outright malicious, it is often better to be polite than to be right.

-	Digievolutions. They are all over the place, you have a single wild Devimon taking down the whole digidestined squad without breaking a sweat, and meanwhile you have these legendary Dark Masters known to be both ruthless and uber powerful…getting bodied by Ultimate. What do they have in common? The powerlevels fluctuate in order to make the story more interesting and engaging, ergo we are looking for the same, where the focus is more on roleplaying and everybody having a fun adventure than hyperfocusing on numbers. That being said, don’t expect your just-born Koromon to be able to take on a Wargreymon. 

-	The Digivice are items that allow for the evolution of partner digimon, or for the jogress between a spirit and a human. That being said majority will only be able to have one partner/spirit at the start of the roleplay, with a maximum of three (between solo digimon and spirits, although spirits that belong to a similar/equal line get treated as evolutions of a singular digimon rather than their own entity. For example starting as the Human Spirit of Darkness and then obtaining the Beast Spirit of it counts as a singular digimon rather than two separate entities). The in-universe explanation for this is that majority of digivices are more specialized to handle a singular digimon, and further partners require some special software and hardware that are hard to find.

-	That being said, while lore-wise each digivice has some uniqueness or specialization of it in the original, and in this roleplay the Data Squad’s digivice is a lesser version of Gennai’s design because of it being reverse engineered by humans, when it comes to actually roleplaying there’s really no intrinsic difference between them other than their model nor any actual benefit from using a VERY specific one. 

-	OC digimon are more than welcome, only thing is don’t make them this OP character that can’t be hit and that automatically kills everything it touches. Nobody wants to play with that dude, absolutely nobody.
- All questions regarding canoncity, certain digimons being usable, powerlevels and whatnots should be directed to Kythyria Zapdos#0135


- If canon specifies there's exactly one of something, players can't claim exclusive right to play it. Either it's off-limits, can be borrowed as an NPC, or there's more than one of it

There are two paths that the trains take you two, both with vastly different biomes: 

Ancient Village : As if you were transported several thousand years back, a town that is more reminiscent of primitive human life than anything, yet its inhabitants are a combination of plant, primate and dragon digimon living and coexisting with one another. Majority of them are rookies with a few Hanumon defending the village. Curators, shamans, hunters and gatherers reunite to cooperate in the long battle against the many danger that living in such a primitive society carries. Beyond their borders there exist ruthless champion digimon roaming the area, the survival of the fittest being the only thing that matters to the giants that loom over the flora.

Sandstorm Village: Temples to goddesses have been erected in this village where the sands reign the domains, merchants trading and selling, thieves and guards battling every day, houses made out or sand and rock decorating the many streets of this rather humble place. However, they have more than enough food and water thanks to the many gifts the desert provides them with: Bellow the sand and beyond their fortified domain exist several sand-welling digimon big enough as to provide sustenance to the villagers, alongside the many fruits and other items one might find in what at first glance appears to be the death of life, yet upon closer inspection, might be as merciful on its gifts-if not more, than most biomes. It is said that randomly, a human might find out of place items upon the sands, between food, electronics and even toys. While digimon can be fortunate enough to find some themselves, it appears humans have a higher chance to encounter something on that mantle of sand if they dig deep enough. 

Machine town: The first thing you might notice about this place is how low quality the ground is, as if it had been punished so hard by pollution the fact that there’s a floor that’s not metal to begin with is almost surprising. Large complexes made of a single, strong material with their only distinction being the weird shapes they take, and the many gears that protrude from their homes. Recycling plants, Manufacturing plants and automated plants reign supreme in these lands, as assembling machine digimon appear to be the common goal of these factories. Due to the requirement of expensive and sometimes imported materials, only Champion digimon roam the streets, with only few of them having reached a level to Ultimate or similar to it in their champion form.  While one might think this is all orquestrated by a singular super-advanced AI, the weird truth is that majority of machine digimon in here have been programmed to follow a directive to [build and create] more of their own and thus, no real central government exists bare if you count said programming as one. There are some non-machine digimon here and there, but are the minority compared to the machines, mostly those that trade precious parts from places the machines cannot reach themselves, due to the sheer amount of danger that threatens their livelihood and the possibility of losing said parts forever, their sheer need to build and repair, or the possibility of running out of batteries in the wild. You’d think there are no feral machine digimon seeing as majority of them are programmed, yet that couldn’t be further from the truth. Some of them are built lacking some parts, or they are a combination of parts that were never truly recycled, thus they are either robots following a bizarre, unpredictable code or those infected by something that made them go AWRY

Icy Wildlands
The frozen hellscape that is the wildlands of ice are some of the most unforgiving territories you can ever find, as the icy tundra WILL drain your stamina if you are not insulated enough. Mountains of snow and ice welcome you, but keep quiet, as enough vibration might make these giants shake and create an avalanche upon yourself. While some might claim these to be partly ocean territories due to large bodies of pure ice being considered one, there are also other, rarer digimon that can only be found here-In fact, you can even find some real dangerous digimon trapped in chunks of ice. Be not a fool to awaken sleeping dragons. Unfortunately, villagers might require substenance and they find themselves having to hunt or fight for their survival, being not safe from the waters above nor the ice that  is host of so many strong creatures. It is the only place without a DSHQ as often than not the sheer amount of energy and money required to maintain a post there is  often way too much for "what is worth". Here might be a good place for those that require "a little more hump" if danger is what they want in their plate.
