> S: Perhaps Gennai decided on children out of fear that adults might cause MORE harm than good to the digital world, as seen in 02 and Data Squad.

Part of criteria for "promising" is jumping at the call.

If there's more openness between the worlds rather than just chosen heroes/villains crossing over, the Gennais are very much the mon counterpart of the Data Squad. Even if they aren't, really: the Gennais cast the "Summon Everyman Hero"... but the DS cast "Summon Every*mon* Hero". In the more open world, Gennais are responsible for humans that end up in the digiworld, and the DS vice versa.

Digivices aren't converged with smartphones, they just do the tamer thing.

> S: So if a human wants to go to the digital world, they don't go as tamer but rather AS the "digimon" via the spirits?

Main character types
* spirit tamer
* solo mon
* perhaps easier than 01 tamer to integrate into this, is matrix tamer: like a spirit tamer but you have a regular mon instead of a spirit

Like a mon in the human world, humans in the digiworld are at a disadvantage just by being human. Being at least part time mon is one way around this, and besides, if you resonate with a mon or a spirit enough to be a tamer you're halfway to matrix or spirit evolution.

Also possible:
> S: Then how about going the Nintendo DS route and have it be an internet hub accessed via the tamagochi toy? Like they are these expensive "keys" to the digital world that grant you a single egg from which a digimon can be born. There, humans can either go the tamer route or use spirits, while digimon can go solo and go full adventure mode.
