title: "Raw notes"

This file is a random selection of largely unfiltered thoughts. Take it with a pinch of salt.

> S: Perhaps Gennai decided on children out of fear that adults might cause MORE harm than good to the digital world, as seen in 02 and Data Squad.  
> S: But any human that synchs with a digimon CAN travel to the digital world, Gennai simply gave that needed "push" for the kids to answer the call?  
> S:Hell usually when adults feel something weird or something "calling" for them it's usually brushed off as being too tired, watching too many movies, or shrugging it as some other dude with their name.  
> S: Although this makes me wonder, perhaps the "call" is something beyond any regular person's powers, as it's merely a digimon and a tamer of equal frequencies "syncing" with each other.

> K: Maybe Gennai chose to boost the signal for promising kids?  
> K: You need a way in (or out, if you're a digimon) of the digiworld. Takes a strong will to pry it open if it's not already open?

Part of criteria for "promising" is jumping at the call.

If there's more openness between the worlds rather than just chosen heroes/villains crossing over, the Gennais are very much the mon counterpart of the Data Squad. Even if they aren't, really: the Gennais cast the "Summon Everyman Hero"... but the DS cast "Summon Every*mon* Hero". In the more open world, Gennais are responsible for humans that end up in the digiworld, and the DS vice versa.

> S: So if a human wants to go to the digital world, they don't go as tamer but rather AS the "digimon" via the spirits?

Main character types
* spirit tamer
* solo mon
* perhaps easier than 01 tamer to integrate into this, is matrix tamer: like a spirit tamer but you have a regular mon instead of a spirit

Like a mon in the human world, humans in the digiworld are at a disadvantage just by being human. Being at least part time mon is one way around this, and besides, if you resonate with a mon or a spirit enough to be a tamer you're halfway to matrix or spirit evolution.

Also possible:
> S: Then how about going the Nintendo DS route and have it be an internet hub accessed via the tamagochi toy? Like they are these expensive "keys" to the digital world that grant you a single egg from which a digimon can be born. There, humans can either go the tamer route or use spirits, while digimon can go solo and go full adventure mode.

Tamers are inherently matrix or spirit tamers: Being a tamer at all, having a digivice, connects you to the mon and that's the first stage of that evolution type. Hence why in Colon Joe can use Zudomon's hammer. But this has another side: digimon grow *differently* when they have a tamer.

But with a human wrangling them, that human's interactions tend to add new code. In short, digimon are *very* impressionable, and it changes their very being.

> S: I mean there's a bunch of mons that are basically feral, now imagine human interaction as adding "code" to said program with the human showing them kindness and love, or hatred and pain, and the mon is basically a sponge that expands their range of utilities not necessarily power-wise, but mental wise. That's why care mistakes are live-or-death vital to a digimon, you are basically imprinting them with code as an user.  
> ...You know, perhaps that's another reason human children are chosen rather than adults.  
> They kind of both grow together, and it's easier for children to think of digimon as their "beloved mascots/friends"
> Ergo, reducing any occurrence of care mistakes that could turn the legendary Greymon supposed to save the world into a Machinedramon with the power of G O D

There's an obvious source of villains in this, a manipulative mon glomming on to a human to get the boost (bit of a gamble, if your human turns out to be virtuous rather than corruptible you run the risk of becoming a goody-two-shoes yourself) and then going all you have outlived your usefulness. The matrix of what's a care mistake is different for such a mon, too. Possibly these sorts of mons try to organise it based on one party "hiring" the other.

Crests are a thing, the reason you don't see ones based on negative traits is because the gennais and DS both tend to bury that. The math implies the existence of, say, a rage crest, because crests exist at all, but nobody except card carrying villains wants the kind of mon or tamer that's compatible with that running around. 

If we went to the human world there's kind of three groups:
> 1. Chosen Children who resonated with digimon hard enough to be yeeted into the digital world
> 2. People working for DS who were given a specialized digivices and a digimon egg to take care of. Might not grow as strong as the former but are better trained than the chosen ones
> 3. High-end criminal organization that are salivating at the prospect of the cheapest nukes known to man

This isn't a straight-up thing, you won't see 2 or 3 much until stuff gets high-powered.
DS might actually be ok with chosen children once the compatibility of goals is shown.
The ~~Payday Gang~~ ~~Team Rocket~~ Yakuza (or whoever) are, of course, villains.
Murder, extortion, and robbery and that's *before* they get digimon.
DS want to maintain the masquerade pretty hard, they really don't want any more criminals aware of digimon (or the public really, PR headache).

Chosen Children or Digimon (need a name for those) thus have to keep under the radar themselves when in the human world.

One of the ways you can get into the digiworld is by travelling, and taking an unusual diversion.
In particular, you might find yourself with a special train ticket that... well, depending on where you use it the station might grow an extra platform, or just going through the ticket barrier takes you to a different place.
At that extra platform is, of course, a trailmon or several, or in some cases the gear to spirit evolve *into* a trailmon.
Travel from there is straightforward.

But train stations are inherently liminal, and liminality can weaken the walls of reality, so sometimes things cross over without such formality.
Vendors selling tickets.
Suspicious beings selling things that the authorities, any authorities, would frown on.
Yourself.
This can get pretty dramatic, at the shadier places and times an uncomfortable-looking and chained digimon won't raise eyebrows.
Possibly you bought that mon from a shady dude who sold you what looked like a 2000s cellphone and the "pet" came part of the package.
At other times all you'll notice is that the merchandise in the shops is different.
Especially if you were in somewhere like St Pancras that has an outright expy in the digiworld.

Applimon are just another sort of digimon based on different data.

One can either play as a human with a partner digimon, a regular human with spirit jogressing or a lonesome digimon that acts as a self-employed adventurer.

There are two paths that the trains take you two, both with vastly different biomes: 

Ancient Village : As if you were transported several thousand years back, a town that is more reminiscent of primitive human life than anything, yet its inhabitants are a combination of plant, primate and dragon digimon living and coexisting with one another. Majority of them are rookies with a few Hanumon defending the village. Curators, shamans, hunters and gatherers reunite to cooperate in the long battle against the many danger that living in such a primitive society carries. Beyond their borders there exist ruthless champion digimon roaming the area, the survival of the fittest being the only thing that matters to the giants that loom over the flora.

Sandstorm Village: Temples to goddesses have been erected in this village where the sands reign the domains, merchants trading and selling, thieves and guards battling every day, houses made out or sand and rock decorating the many streets of this rather humble place. However, they have more than enough food and water thanks to the many gifts the desert provides them with: Bellow the sand and beyond their fortified domain exist several sand-welling digimon big enough as to provide sustenance to the villagers, alongside the many fruits and other items one might find in what at first glance appears to be the death of life, yet upon closer inspection, might be as merciful on its gifts-if not more, than most biomes. It is said that randomly, a human might find out of place items upon the sands, between food, electronics and even toys. While digimon can be fortunate enough to find some themselves, it appears humans have a higher chance to encounter something on that mantle of sand if they dig deep enough. 

Machine town: The first thing you might notice about this place is how low quality the ground is, as if it had been punished so hard by pollution the fact that there’s a floor that’s not metal to begin with is almost surprising. Large complexes made of a single, strong material with their only distinction being the weird shapes they take, and the many gears that protrude from their homes. Recycling plants, Manufacturing plants and automated plants reign supreme in these lands, as assembling machine digimon appear to be the common goal of these factories. Due to the requirement of expensive and sometimes imported materials, only Champion digimon roam the streets, with only few of them having reached a level to Ultimate or similar to it in their champion form.  While one might think this is all orquestrated by a singular super-advanced AI, the weird truth is that majority of machine digimon in here have been programmed to follow a directive to [build and create] more of their own and thus, no real central government exists bare if you count said programming as one. There are some non-machine digimon here and there, but are the minority compared to the machines, mostly those that trade precious parts from places the machines cannot reach themselves, due to the sheer amount of danger that threatens their livelihood and the possibility of losing said parts forever, their sheer need to build and repair, or the possibility of running out of batteries in the wild. You’d think there are no feral machine digimon seeing as majority of them are programmed, yet that couldn’t be further from the truth. Some of them are built lacking some parts, or they are a combination of parts that were never truly recycled, thus they are either robots following a bizarre, unpredictable code or those infected by something that made them go AWRY

Icy Wildlands:
The frozen hellscape that is the wildlands of ice are some of the most unforgiving territories you can ever find, as the icy tundra WILL drain your stamina if you are not insulated enough. Mountains of snow and ice welcome you, but keep quiet, as enough vibration might make these giants shake and create an avalanche upon yourself. While some might claim these to be partly ocean territories due to large bodies of pure ice being considered one, there are also other, rarer digimon that can only be found here-In fact, you can even find some real dangerous digimon trapped in chunks of ice. Be not a fool to awaken sleeping dragons. Unfortunately, villagers might require substenance and they find themselves having to hunt or fight for their survival, being not safe from the waters above nor the ice that  is host of so many strong creatures. It is the only place without a DSHQ as often than not the sheer amount of energy and money required to maintain a post there is  often way too much for "what is worth". Here might be a good place for those that require "a little more hump" if danger is what they want in their plate. 

Machine Wildlands: Scraps of metal, destroyed buildings, all gathered in a landscape where contamination is king. What happens when an accumulation of human technology, trash and appliances find themselves gathered in one place? The digital worlds has no waste, and soon enough machines will dissasemble, join together, and form part of a bigger, stronger whole. The creatures made out of machines are no different than beasts that thirst for blood, and will no doubt try to get as much data as possible in order to upgrade their forms. Even some of the more sane machine digimon might see themselves affected, either by glitches or bugs and, finding no help, will end up becoming rogue. Strangely, partner digimon rarely, if ever, suffer from these problems, as if they bond they share with their tamer prevent them from such a fact, although a powerful-enough digimon might be able to tamper with them to some extend. Be careful when walking  through seas of scrap and mountains of trash, you might end up accidentally awakening a metal beast in the process...or several.

## Missions and Jobs (Hidden stuff, backburner for missions)

In all cities, there's always a place where people and digimon gather, and where they gather, rumors and "requests" are often heard and even comissioned. Some digimon have made their lives going on missions, on hunts and rescuing others from their problems. Others have worked as hitmen and thieves for the right price. Mostly, these places are bars, clubs and the like where informality is king, but there might be other places that might require your strenght, and that would pay...handsomely for your help.

The Heist: There have been rumors of digimon awaiting for humans at the train station in order to rob them, some have even been robbed their digivice! Luckily, you were not one of them, but we might need someone to go scout for us and aprehend the criminal. 

The Train Robbery: We've got news from the train with destination to (insert random name here), it has been hijacked and the people held ransom, we must do something! You will be carried by an Airdramon and dropped on top of the train!

The Cave:  There have been strange disappearances as workers working for a mining company dived into a cave to extract minerals, only to never return. We need to rescue them at any cost!

The convoy: A convoy carrying food and medicine has been intercepted by...something! Head to the desert and rescue the drivers. If possible, try to salvage some of the medicine!

Burning Hearts, the last crusade : (This is an evolving  mission. Rookies will be accompanied by Agumon, further evolutions will be accompanied by evolutions of this line) "Agh! Those damn Gabumon think they are better than us!? That living cozy lives and gathering flabber under their coat is dignifying of a digimon!? Help us settle our difference against those nerds!"

Cold Minds, the last crusade: (This is an evolving  mission. Rookies will be accompanied by Gabumon, further evolutions will be accompanied by evolutions of this line) "Rowdy orange necks, the lot of them! Those illiterates will bother our consciousness no more, we will show them the difference between a civilized digimon and a simpleton that thinks that swinging a tree branch is 'skill'. Aid us in putting an end to this most infuriating rivalry against those meat-for-brains!"
