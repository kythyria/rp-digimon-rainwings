> S: Perhaps Gennai decided on children out of fear that adults might cause MORE harm than good to the digital world, as seen in 02 and Data Squad.  
> S: But any human that synchs with a digimon CAN travel to the digital world, Gennai simply gave that needed "push" for the kids to answer the call?  
> S:Hell usually when adults feel something weird or something "calling" for them it's usually brushed off as being too tired, watching too many movies, or shrugging it as some other dude with their name.  
> S: Although this makes me wonder, perhaps the "call" is something beyond any regular person's powers, as it's merely a digimon and a tamer of equal frequencies "syncing" with each other.

> K: Maybe Gennai chose to boost the signal for promising kids?  
> K: You need a way in (or out, if you're a digimon) of the digiworld. Takes a strong will to pry it open if it's not already open?

Part of criteria for "promising" is jumping at the call.

If there's more openness between the worlds rather than just chosen heroes/villains crossing over, the Gennais are very much the mon counterpart of the Data Squad. Even if they aren't, really: the Gennais cast the "Summon Everyman Hero"... but the DS cast "Summon Every*mon* Hero". In the more open world, Gennais are responsible for humans that end up in the digiworld, and the DS vice versa.

Digivices aren't converged with smartphones, they just do the tamer thing.

> S: So if a human wants to go to the digital world, they don't go as tamer but rather AS the "digimon" via the spirits?

Main character types
* spirit tamer
* solo mon
* perhaps easier than 01 tamer to integrate into this, is matrix tamer: like a spirit tamer but you have a regular mon instead of a spirit

Like a mon in the human world, humans in the digiworld are at a disadvantage just by being human. Being at least part time mon is one way around this, and besides, if you resonate with a mon or a spirit enough to be a tamer you're halfway to matrix or spirit evolution.

Also possible:
> S: Then how about going the Nintendo DS route and have it be an internet hub accessed via the tamagochi toy? Like they are these expensive "keys" to the digital world that grant you a single egg from which a digimon can be born. There, humans can either go the tamer route or use spirits, while digimon can go solo and go full adventure mode.

Tamers are inherently matrix or spirit tamers: Being a tamer at all, having a digivice, connects you to the mon and that's the first stage of that evolution type. Hence why in Colon Joe can use Zudomon's hammer. But this has another side: digimon grow *differently* when they have a tamer.

Ordinarily they were born from data and generally either stay as quite dedicated to a function, or become feral, the wild fauna or random encounters. Some reach a somewhat humanlike mindset and that gets you your villages and stuff. But with a human wrangling them, that human's interactions tend to add new code. In short, digimon are *very* impressionable, and it changes their very being.

> S: I mean there's a bunch of mons that are basically feral, now imagine human interaction as adding "code" to said program with the human showing them kindness and love, or hatred and pain, and the mon is basically a sponge that expands their range of utilities not necessarily power-wise, but mental wise. That's why care mistakes are live-or-death vital to a digimon, you are basically imprinting them with code as an user.  
> ...You know, perhaps that's another reason human children are chosen rather than adults.  
> They kind of both grow together, and it's easier for children to think of digimon as their "beloved mascots/friends"
> Ergo, reducing any occurrence of care mistakes that could turn the legendary Greymon supposed to save the world into a Machinedramon with the power of G O D

The same link that lets this work also makes humans very tough: The mon protects them even if that couldn't have a physical basis (hence why colon Tai can stay on Greymon in fights).

There's an obvious source of villains in this, a manipulative mon glomming on to a human to get the boost (bit of a gamble, if your human turns out to be virtuous rather than corruptible you run the risk of becoming a goody-two-shoes yourself) and then going all you have outlived your usefulness. The matrix of what's a care mistake is different for such a mon, too. Possibly these sorts of mons try to organise it based on one party "hiring" the other.

Crests are a thing, the reason you don't see ones based on negative traits is because the gennais and DS both tend to bury that. The math implies the existence of, say, a rage crest, because crests exist at all, but nobody except card carrying villains wants the kind of mon or tamer that's compatible with that running around. 

If we went to the human world there's kind of three groups:
> 1. Chosen Children who resonated with digimon hard enough to be yeeted into the digital world
> 2. People working for DS who were given a specialized digivices and a digimon egg to take care of. Might not grow as strong as the former but are better trained than the chosen ones
> 3. High-end criminal organization that are salivating at the prospect of the cheapest nukes known to man

This isn't a straight-up thing, you won't see 2 or 3 much until stuff gets high-powered.
DS might actually be ok with chosen children once the compatibility of goals is shown.
The ~~Payday Gang~~ ~~Team Rocket~~ Yakuza (or whoever) are, of course, villains.
Murder, extortion, and robbery and that's *before* they get digimon.
DS want to maintain the masquerade pretty hard, they really don't want any more criminals aware of digimon (or the public really, PR headache).

Chosen Children or Digimon (need a name for those) thus have to keep under the radar themselves when in the human world.

You can't be a spirit tamer AND a regular tamer at once. They both compete for the same resources and Bad Things happen if you run out of those.
Rampages, random unconsciousness, the full monty.
Especially since spirit evolution is more demanding: "taming" a spirit requires that you fill in the many components missing from the spirit with your own.
Doing this is inherently jogress-like, which is why it doesn't spawn a mon but turn you into one.

Spirits are sort of fossils of digimon. Lacking fundamental parts (think "event loop", for instance), they are inert objects unless attached to a human or digimon.
This requires mental compatibility, like canon Agunimon really needs to be used by... well, someone as goggleboy-y as Takuya is.
There's a very basic harness in a spirit's shrine, but it's not really enough for the spirit to *do* much.
Compatibility comes in degrees, the more you have it the better spirit evolution works for you.

One of the ways you can get into the digiworld is by travelling, and taking an unusual diversion.
In particular, you might find yourself with a special train ticket that... well, depending on where you use it the station might grow an extra platform, or just going through the ticket barrier takes you to a different place.
At that extra platform is, of course, a trailmon or several, or in some cases the gear to spirit evolve *into* a trailmon.
Travel from there is straightforward.

But train stations are inherently liminal, and liminality can weaken the walls of reality, so sometimes things cross over without such formality.
Vendors selling tickets.
Suspicious beings selling things that the authorities, any authorities, would frown on.
Yourself.
This can get pretty dramatic, at the shadier places and times an uncomfortable-looking and chained digimon won't raise eyebrows.
Possibly you bought that mon from a shady dude who sold you what looked like a 2000s cellphone and the "pet" came part of the package.
At other times all you'll notice is that the merchandise in the shops is different.
Especially if you were in somewhere like St Pancras that has an outright expy in the digiworld.

Trailmon lines go to some weird places.
There's at least one station in the middle of inky black primordial void, and it's not a terminus.
There's places where the rail "prop" and the lineness don't even pretend to line up.
One station is configured to resemble a (pre bogie-exchange) gauge change station, even though there's no visible reason.

Some of these are required by mathematical theorems underpinning the trailmon network.  
Some are _not_.

Other places... there's very few automobiles.
Most transport is trailmon, artificial trains, riding another mon, or digivolving into something suitable.
Yes, you can hire a private railcar or an entire train.
There's rumours of some kid who got a trailmon partner and found a way for it to rez momentary rails _wherever it likes_
(he has to control this manually, trailmon are surprisingly resistant to the concept of corners).

Applimon are just another sort of digimon based on different data.

There are non-digimon lifeforms, they're pretty low on the scale of animacy (even feral digimon are smarter).
Besides plants, there's some livestock, although whether any given food item comes from plant or animal or natural resource node is unconnected with what it appears to be.
Strict vegans may as well give up, thanks to grass-type mons and meat plants.

Also low on the scale of animacy are artifacts: "magic items" that don't have enough of the relevant complexity to become digimon, but too much to just be inert objects.
You might need to attune to one to use it, or it might be a bit fiddly to use because it's got proto-preferences.
Really complex automation winds up either being effectively a mon or being based on a mon jacking in so that the mon's event loop and such can be borrowed.
This *is* compatible with being/having a tamer.

There's a few cities, though new tamers don't start in one.
Rather more small towns and villages: you'll get tiny villages that are more or less monospecies.
Even random installations like a cafe in the middle of nowhere.
Towns vary a bit more: most have a single trailmon line.

Another cause of random installations and villages is navigable waterways: locks, lifts, and bridges sometimes have a mon looking after them.
Yes, there's boats, sometimes mon-hauled, or you can just ride an aquatic mon if you don't mind getting wet (or have a Submarimon).
You might need a narrowboat to get up some of the thinner canals; it's not the fastest way to get around, but there's sizeable chunks of land with no railway.
This includes a desert where you can also sail in a sandboat and fish for desert-themed digimon.

The digiworld considers euclidean geometry to be for boring people.
The aforementioned desert, for instance, has a canal across it that is quite a bit shorter if you're floating on it.
Indoor spaces have a disconcerting tendency to straight up be in a different worldspace, so subway lines have very different lengths and routes to what you'd expect from station placement.
Heck, there's a forest with a high-rise tree where climbing a ladder into the permanent cloud at the top takes you to someplace quite different (but beware, where it comes out changes without warning).

One can either play as a human with a partner digimon, a regular human with spirit jogressing or a lonesome digimon that acts as a self-employed adventurer.
