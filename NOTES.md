> S: Perhaps Gennai decided on children out of fear that adults might cause MORE harm than good to the digital world, as seen in 02 and Data Squad.  
> S: But any human that synchs with a digimon CAN travel to the digital world, Gennai simply gave that needed "push" for the kids to answer the call?  
> S:Hell usually when adults feel something weird or something "calling" for them it's usually brushed off as being too tired, watching too many movies, or shrugging it as some other dude with their name.  
> S: Although this makes me wonder, perhaps the "call" is something beyond any regular person's powers, as it's merely a digimon and a tamer of equal frequencies "syncing" with each other.

> K: Maybe Gennai chose to boost the signal for promising kids?  
> K: You need a way in (or out, if you're a digimon) of the digiworld. Takes a strong will to pry it open if it's not already open?

Part of criteria for "promising" is jumping at the call.

If there's more openness between the worlds rather than just chosen heroes/villains crossing over, the Gennais are very much the mon counterpart of the Data Squad. Even if they aren't, really: the Gennais cast the "Summon Everyman Hero"... but the DS cast "Summon Every*mon* Hero". In the more open world, Gennais are responsible for humans that end up in the digiworld, and the DS vice versa.

> S: So if a human wants to go to the digital world, they don't go as tamer but rather AS the "digimon" via the spirits?

Main character types
* spirit tamer
* solo mon
* perhaps easier than 01 tamer to integrate into this, is matrix tamer: like a spirit tamer but you have a regular mon instead of a spirit

Like a mon in the human world, humans in the digiworld are at a disadvantage just by being human. Being at least part time mon is one way around this, and besides, if you resonate with a mon or a spirit enough to be a tamer you're halfway to matrix or spirit evolution.

Also possible:
> S: Then how about going the Nintendo DS route and have it be an internet hub accessed via the tamagochi toy? Like they are these expensive "keys" to the digital world that grant you a single egg from which a digimon can be born. There, humans can either go the tamer route or use spirits, while digimon can go solo and go full adventure mode.

Tamers are inherently matrix or spirit tamers: Being a tamer at all, having a digivice, connects you to the mon and that's the first stage of that evolution type. Hence why in Colon Joe can use Zudomon's hammer. But this has another side: digimon grow *differently* when they have a tamer.

But with a human wrangling them, that human's interactions tend to add new code. In short, digimon are *very* impressionable, and it changes their very being.

> S: I mean there's a bunch of mons that are basically feral, now imagine human interaction as adding "code" to said program with the human showing them kindness and love, or hatred and pain, and the mon is basically a sponge that expands their range of utilities not necessarily power-wise, but mental wise. That's why care mistakes are live-or-death vital to a digimon, you are basically imprinting them with code as an user.  
> ...You know, perhaps that's another reason human children are chosen rather than adults.  
> They kind of both grow together, and it's easier for children to think of digimon as their "beloved mascots/friends"
> Ergo, reducing any occurrence of care mistakes that could turn the legendary Greymon supposed to save the world into a Machinedramon with the power of G O D

There's an obvious source of villains in this, a manipulative mon glomming on to a human to get the boost (bit of a gamble, if your human turns out to be virtuous rather than corruptible you run the risk of becoming a goody-two-shoes yourself) and then going all you have outlived your usefulness. The matrix of what's a care mistake is different for such a mon, too. Possibly these sorts of mons try to organise it based on one party "hiring" the other.

Crests are a thing, the reason you don't see ones based on negative traits is because the gennais and DS both tend to bury that. The math implies the existence of, say, a rage crest, because crests exist at all, but nobody except card carrying villains wants the kind of mon or tamer that's compatible with that running around. 

If we went to the human world there's kind of three groups:
> 1. Chosen Children who resonated with digimon hard enough to be yeeted into the digital world
> 2. People working for DS who were given a specialized digivices and a digimon egg to take care of. Might not grow as strong as the former but are better trained than the chosen ones
> 3. High-end criminal organization that are salivating at the prospect of the cheapest nukes known to man

This isn't a straight-up thing, you won't see 2 or 3 much until stuff gets high-powered.
DS might actually be ok with chosen children once the compatibility of goals is shown.
The ~~Payday Gang~~ ~~Team Rocket~~ Yakuza (or whoever) are, of course, villains.
Murder, extortion, and robbery and that's *before* they get digimon.
DS want to maintain the masquerade pretty hard, they really don't want any more criminals aware of digimon (or the public really, PR headache).

Chosen Children or Digimon (need a name for those) thus have to keep under the radar themselves when in the human world.

One of the ways you can get into the digiworld is by travelling, and taking an unusual diversion.
In particular, you might find yourself with a special train ticket that... well, depending on where you use it the station might grow an extra platform, or just going through the ticket barrier takes you to a different place.
At that extra platform is, of course, a trailmon or several, or in some cases the gear to spirit evolve *into* a trailmon.
Travel from there is straightforward.

But train stations are inherently liminal, and liminality can weaken the walls of reality, so sometimes things cross over without such formality.
Vendors selling tickets.
Suspicious beings selling things that the authorities, any authorities, would frown on.
Yourself.
This can get pretty dramatic, at the shadier places and times an uncomfortable-looking and chained digimon won't raise eyebrows.
Possibly you bought that mon from a shady dude who sold you what looked like a 2000s cellphone and the "pet" came part of the package.
At other times all you'll notice is that the merchandise in the shops is different.
Especially if you were in somewhere like St Pancras that has an outright expy in the digiworld.

Applimon are just another sort of digimon based on different data.

One can either play as a human with a partner digimon, a regular human with spirit jogressing or a lonesome digimon that acts as a self-employed adventurer. 

After the events of Shinjiku in 2004, the Japanese government could no longer cover the existence of digimon to the rest of the world nor that of the chosen children. Due mostly to the fact that said children now were international rather than Japanese-born, and the fact that they required said digidestined to stop a creature capable of wiping out humanity. They were literally relying on a miracle at that point since no modern weaponry could even scrath the D-Reaper, even a nuke would be but a minor inconvenience to that thing, and perhaps even aiding it. Upon meeting, The United Nations decided to initiate project Data Squad, a decentralized organization all over the world in charge of dealing with digimon that end up in the human world. Either helping them find a good tamer to bond if they are tame enough, or in the worst case, eliminating said target. While there was a time Data Squad scouted for Digidestined, the conflict from both parties rose as the kind of chosen that could make good solders would usually be against the more…”Just following orders” side of the organization. 

Thus, they began to scout for people with skills and that had been witness to digimon activity, but had not been paired with a digimon. They are then trained, given a digivice and a digimon to take care of and then sent to missions either in the real world or in the digital world. Despite the name, the “digivice” created by Data Squad is vastly inferior to that of the Chosen, but can still evolve their digimon under regular circumstances and if all the conditions are met. However, they are much more specialized and learned than your regular middle school kid, as usually Data Squad agents are young adults at their youngest.


Jungle Biomes : Beauty that can surpass even what one can witness back in the human world, hiding terrifying creatures that are more than willing to fight to the death for the smallest of prey. The creatures found in areas of thick foliage where no civilization is found are usually in the deep end of feralism, sometimes not even the best Data Squad tamer can bring them to their side. In this case, it IS a digimon-eats-digimon world, where the strong rule and the weak perish, becoming substenance for the winner. In a more grotesque display of animalistic behavior, some digimon outright tear off parts of their prey in order to fasten the rate by which a digimon decomposes into smaller bits , whih can be quite graphic for those unprepared. However, there EXIST rather primitive villages composed of digimon that are barely conscious and while they MAY be able to communicate discretion is still advised. 

Desert Biomes: When one thinks of deserts, death, decay and drought are usually what comes to mind, yet the digital version of such places couldn’t be far from the truth. In such extreme climates, the hunt is as dangerous as anywhere else, digimon and tamers alike venturing in this sea of sand in order to fish for creatures that swim through the scorching desert.  Thus, small oasis can be artificially create, settlements exist where richness and abundance seemingly contradict the “death” of their surroundings, where nothing should ever grow. Thus, being lost in the desert might not be a death sentence, as long as you don’t encounter things as equally lucky as you, if not a bit more. There are even some weird occurrences when, in the middle of the desert, one can find things like fridges or other electro domestics lying around with seemingly no way of ever reaching that place, and definitely not being powered up by anything, yet functioning as if they were. So salvation might come to the straggler, in the form of a cold one-or several ones, well, as long as it is not something that’s been deliberately put there. It is said that there’s an underground channel, a collection of tunnels dug by digimon that usually lead to either someplace where there’s food or even to civilization. Be careful, however, as these digimon do not seek those places to do trade exactly, and you might end up having to fend off against giant beasts that lurk in these dark tunnels.

The very first place humans are likely to see is the Station, usually by accident: it's easy to just warp into the station accidentally, because reality is so thin there and train stations exist in order to travel anyway. But if you're on the platforms it's still a U-shaped Victorian neo-gothic edifice, all red brick and slightly pointy or perfectly circular arches and window frames with sandstone accents. Then between the arms soars an enormous, also slightly pointy, cast iron and rivet frame holding up a mostly glass roof and the huge floodlamps that light the space at night. They're clearly not lamps of human manufacture, involving crystals and lenses, but still lamps.

It's hard to tell from inside, but the platforms are on the second floor. While you could go through the big arch at the front front (as big digimon often do), most travellers go down the stairs onto the main concourse, at first glance like any other terminus concourse: the ticket offices, shops catering to travellers in a hurry, departure boards, all that jazz. But most of the text is digimoji, and the travellers are mostly digimon. Indeed, the relatively low ceilings of the concourse must be cramped for some of the bigger ones. If you don't get sidetracked by the stairs down to the *other* platforms, lunch, or the warren of corridors that the ends of the main concourse degenerate into, you can walk out the side doors into the town proper.

Oh, and at night the station changes quite a bit. The trains have wildly different livery matching the different trailmon drawing them, fair enough. But downstairs is a different matter. The lights change their spectrum, yellowing noticeably. There are alleyways where there weren't alleyways before *inside* the station, and different shops are open. If you look closely, some of them were clearly hiding behind a hologram during the day. And much shadier types walk around much more openly, or are behind the counter of the shops, or even just in the less well-lit corridors with little stalls or just a longcoat with pockets. The merchandise is correspondingly... not something you'd buy in broad daylight, or always well described: caveat emptor is in full force at this time.

…and outside the station, a strange sight will greet you. Buildings meshed together with nether rhyme nor reason, neon signs that look futuristic pointing at houses and small business that are as rural as you might imagine, or buildings made out of wood and stone that combined form a strange and almost chaotic form of symmetry that makes no sense-yet does at the same time. Some of these buildings have doors that only a kid and a digimon can pass through without much problem, leaving theories as to what-or who might have constructed this place in the minds of adults that might need to crouch uncomfortably to get inside. Statues and decorations constructed with the most random items you could ever think of pointing at different locations, growing in strangeness the further you walk from the center of this bizarre town. 
Strangely, the road will simply cut off into wilderness, not even a trail of rocks follows and venturing around the surface might end up with you getting attacked by rookie-level digimon that are a bit too feral to care about dealing with whatever problem they have with you through dialoge.
