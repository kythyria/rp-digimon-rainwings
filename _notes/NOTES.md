title: "Raw notes"
---
This file is a random selection of largely unfiltered thoughts. Take it with a pinch of salt.

> S: Perhaps Gennai decided on children out of fear that adults might cause MORE harm than good to the digital world, as seen in 02 and Data Squad.  
> S: But any human that synchs with a digimon CAN travel to the digital world, Gennai simply gave that needed "push" for the kids to answer the call?  
> S:Hell usually when adults feel something weird or something "calling" for them it's usually brushed off as being too tired, watching too many movies, or shrugging it as some other dude with their name.  
> S: Although this makes me wonder, perhaps the "call" is something beyond any regular person's powers, as it's merely a digimon and a tamer of equal frequencies "syncing" with each other.

> K: Maybe Gennai chose to boost the signal for promising kids?  
> K: You need a way in (or out, if you're a digimon) of the digiworld. Takes a strong will to pry it open if it's not already open?

Part of criteria for "promising" is jumping at the call.

If there's more openness between the worlds rather than just chosen heroes/villains crossing over, the Gennais are very much the mon counterpart of the Data Squad. Even if they aren't, really: the Gennais cast the "Summon Everyman Hero"... but the DS cast "Summon Every*mon* Hero". In the more open world, Gennais are responsible for humans that end up in the digiworld, and the DS vice versa.

> S: So if a human wants to go to the digital world, they don't go as tamer but rather AS the "digimon" via the spirits?

Main character types
* spirit tamer
* solo mon
* perhaps easier than 01 tamer to integrate into this, is matrix tamer: like a spirit tamer but you have a regular mon instead of a spirit

Like a mon in the human world, humans in the digiworld are at a disadvantage just by being human. Being at least part time mon is one way around this, and besides, if you resonate with a mon or a spirit enough to be a tamer you're halfway to matrix or spirit evolution.

Also possible:
> S: Then how about going the Nintendo DS route and have it be an internet hub accessed via the tamagochi toy? Like they are these expensive "keys" to the digital world that grant you a single egg from which a digimon can be born. There, humans can either go the tamer route or use spirits, while digimon can go solo and go full adventure mode.

Tamers are inherently matrix or spirit tamers: Being a tamer at all, having a digivice, connects you to the mon and that's the first stage of that evolution type. Hence why in Colon Joe can use Zudomon's hammer. But this has another side: digimon grow *differently* when they have a tamer.

But with a human wrangling them, that human's interactions tend to add new code. In short, digimon are *very* impressionable, and it changes their very being.

> S: I mean there's a bunch of mons that are basically feral, now imagine human interaction as adding "code" to said program with the human showing them kindness and love, or hatred and pain, and the mon is basically a sponge that expands their range of utilities not necessarily power-wise, but mental wise. That's why care mistakes are live-or-death vital to a digimon, you are basically imprinting them with code as an user.  
> ...You know, perhaps that's another reason human children are chosen rather than adults.  
> They kind of both grow together, and it's easier for children to think of digimon as their "beloved mascots/friends"
> Ergo, reducing any occurrence of care mistakes that could turn the legendary Greymon supposed to save the world into a Machinedramon with the power of G O D

There's an obvious source of villains in this, a manipulative mon glomming on to a human to get the boost (bit of a gamble, if your human turns out to be virtuous rather than corruptible you run the risk of becoming a goody-two-shoes yourself) and then going all you have outlived your usefulness. The matrix of what's a care mistake is different for such a mon, too. Possibly these sorts of mons try to organise it based on one party "hiring" the other.

Crests are a thing, the reason you don't see ones based on negative traits is because the gennais and DS both tend to bury that. The math implies the existence of, say, a rage crest, because crests exist at all, but nobody except card carrying villains wants the kind of mon or tamer that's compatible with that running around. 

If we went to the human world there's kind of three groups:
> 1. Chosen Children who resonated with digimon hard enough to be yeeted into the digital world
> 2. People working for DS who were given a specialized digivices and a digimon egg to take care of. Might not grow as strong as the former but are better trained than the chosen ones
> 3. High-end criminal organization that are salivating at the prospect of the cheapest nukes known to man

This isn't a straight-up thing, you won't see 2 or 3 much until stuff gets high-powered.
DS might actually be ok with chosen children once the compatibility of goals is shown.
The ~~Payday Gang~~ ~~Team Rocket~~ Yakuza (or whoever) are, of course, villains.
Murder, extortion, and robbery and that's *before* they get digimon.
DS want to maintain the masquerade pretty hard, they really don't want any more criminals aware of digimon (or the public really, PR headache).

Chosen Children or Digimon (need a name for those) thus have to keep under the radar themselves when in the human world.

One of the ways you can get into the digiworld is by travelling, and taking an unusual diversion.
In particular, you might find yourself with a special train ticket that... well, depending on where you use it the station might grow an extra platform, or just going through the ticket barrier takes you to a different place.
At that extra platform is, of course, a trailmon or several, or in some cases the gear to spirit evolve *into* a trailmon.
Travel from there is straightforward.

But train stations are inherently liminal, and liminality can weaken the walls of reality, so sometimes things cross over without such formality.
Vendors selling tickets.
Suspicious beings selling things that the authorities, any authorities, would frown on.
Yourself.
This can get pretty dramatic, at the shadier places and times an uncomfortable-looking and chained digimon won't raise eyebrows.
Possibly you bought that mon from a shady dude who sold you what looked like a 2000s cellphone and the "pet" came part of the package.
At other times all you'll notice is that the merchandise in the shops is different.
Especially if you were in somewhere like St Pancras that has an outright expy in the digiworld.

Applimon are just another sort of digimon based on different data.

One can either play as a human with a partner digimon, a regular human with spirit jogressing or a lonesome digimon that acts as a self-employed adventurer.

There are two paths that the trains take you two, both with vastly different biomes: 

Ancient Village : As if you were transported several thousand years back, a town that is more reminiscent of primitive human life than anything, yet its inhabitants are a combination of plant, primate and dragon digimon living and coexisting with one another. Majority of them are rookies with a few Hanumon defending the village. Curators, shamans, hunters and gatherers reunite to cooperate in the long battle against the many danger that living in such a primitive society carries. Beyond their borders there exist ruthless champion digimon roaming the area, the survival of the fittest being the only thing that matters to the giants that loom over the flora.

Sandstorm Village: Temples to goddesses have been erected in this village where the sands reign the domains, merchants trading and selling, thieves and guards battling every day, houses made out or sand and rock decorating the many streets of this rather humble place. However, they have more than enough food and water thanks to the many gifts the desert provides them with: Bellow the sand and beyond their fortified domain exist several sand-welling digimon big enough as to provide sustenance to the villagers, alongside the many fruits and other items one might find in what at first glance appears to be the death of life, yet upon closer inspection, might be as merciful on its gifts-if not more, than most biomes. It is said that randomly, a human might find out of place items upon the sands, between food, electronics and even toys. While digimon can be fortunate enough to find some themselves, it appears humans have a higher chance to encounter something on that mantle of sand if they dig deep enough. 

Machine town: The first thing you might notice about this place is how low quality the ground is, as if it had been punished so hard by pollution the fact that there’s a floor that’s not metal to begin with is almost surprising. Large complexes made of a single, strong material with their only distinction being the weird shapes they take, and the many gears that protrude from their homes. Recycling plants, Manufacturing plants and automated plants reign supreme in these lands, as assembling machine digimon appear to be the common goal of these factories. Due to the requirement of expensive and sometimes imported materials, only Champion digimon roam the streets, with only few of them having reached a level to Ultimate or similar to it in their champion form.  While one might think this is all orquestrated by a singular super-advanced AI, the weird truth is that majority of machine digimon in here have been programmed to follow a directive to [build and create] more of their own and thus, no real central government exists bare if you count said programming as one. There are some non-machine digimon here and there, but are the minority compared to the machines, mostly those that trade precious parts from places the machines cannot reach themselves, due to the sheer amount of danger that threatens their livelihood and the possibility of losing said parts forever, their sheer need to build and repair, or the possibility of running out of batteries in the wild. You’d think there are no feral machine digimon seeing as majority of them are programmed, yet that couldn’t be further from the truth. Some of them are built lacking some parts, or they are a combination of parts that were never truly recycled, thus they are either robots following a bizarre, unpredictable code or those infected by something that made them go AWRY

Icy Wildlands:
The frozen hellscape that is the wildlands of ice are some of the most unforgiving territories you can ever find, as the icy tundra WILL drain your stamina if you are not insulated enough. Mountains of snow and ice welcome you, but keep quiet, as enough vibration might make these giants shake and create an avalanche upon yourself. While some might claim these to be partly ocean territories due to large bodies of pure ice being considered one, there are also other, rarer digimon that can only be found here-In fact, you can even find some real dangerous digimon trapped in chunks of ice. Be not a fool to awaken sleeping dragons. Unfortunately, villagers might require substenance and they find themselves having to hunt or fight for their survival, being not safe from the waters above nor the ice that  is host of so many strong creatures. It is the only place without a DSHQ as often than not the sheer amount of energy and money required to maintain a post there is  often way too much for "what is worth". Here might be a good place for those that require "a little more hump" if danger is what they want in their plate. 

Machine Wildlands: Scraps of metal, destroyed buildings, all gathered in a landscape where contamination is king. What happens when an accumulation of human technology, trash and appliances find themselves gathered in one place? The digital worlds has no waste, and soon enough machines will dissasemble, join together, and form part of a bigger, stronger whole. The creatures made out of machines are no different than beasts that thirst for blood, and will no doubt try to get as much data as possible in order to upgrade their forms. Even some of the more sane machine digimon might see themselves affected, either by glitches or bugs and, finding no help, will end up becoming rogue. Strangely, partner digimon rarely, if ever, suffer from these problems, as if they bond they share with their tamer prevent them from such a fact, although a powerful-enough digimon might be able to tamper with them to some extend. Be careful when walking  through seas of scrap and mountains of trash, you might end up accidentally awakening a metal beast in the process...or several.

## Missions and Jobs (Hidden stuff, backburner for missions)

In all cities, there's always a place where people and digimon gather, and where they gather, rumors and "requests" are often heard and even comissioned. Some digimon have made their lives going on missions, on hunts and rescuing others from their problems. Others have worked as hitmen and thieves for the right price. Mostly, these places are bars, clubs and the like where informality is king, but there might be other places that might require your strenght, and that would pay...handsomely for your help.

The Heist: There have been rumors of digimon awaiting for humans at the train station in order to rob them, some have even been robbed their digivice! Luckily, you were not one of them, but we might need someone to go scout for us and aprehend the criminal. 

The Train Robbery: We've got news from the train with destination to (insert random name here), it has been hijacked and the people held ransom, we must do something! You will be carried by an Airdramon and dropped on top of the train!

The Cave:  There have been strange disappearances as workers working for a mining company dived into a cave to extract minerals, only to never return. We need to rescue them at any cost!

The convoy: A convoy carrying food and medicine has been intercepted by...something! Head to the desert and rescue the drivers. If possible, try to salvage some of the medicine!

Burning Hearts, the last crusade : (This is an evolving  mission. Rookies will be accompanied by Agumon, further evolutions will be accompanied by evolutions of this line) "Agh! Those damn Gabumon think they are better than us!? That living cozy lives and gathering flabber under their coat is dignifying of a digimon!? Help us settle our difference against those nerds!"

Cold Minds, the last crusade: (This is an evolving  mission. Rookies will be accompanied by Gabumon, further evolutions will be accompanied by evolutions of this line) "Rowdy orange necks, the lot of them! Those illiterates will bother our consciousness no more, we will show them the difference between a civilized digimon and a simpleton that thinks that swinging a tree branch is 'skill'. Aid us in putting an end to this most infuriating rivalry against those meat-for-brains!"

The Love Spot... OF DEATH: What looks like a perfectly inviting romantic getaway spot--apparently digimon do in fact
have those--is secretly a plan by a vampire/demon digimon to feast on the delicious data of the lovers.
A few possible schemes:
    * Museum/mansion that can whisk you away literally as well as metaphorically
    * Romantic garden with lots of cosy spots... that are actually the maw of some huge carnivorous plant digimon.

Solar Apocalymon: The sun is actually a sleeping apocalymon, or orbited by one, or something along those lines.
Regardless, a really really big one, so big that detached arm instances and scaffolding are topographical features.
Then one day someone pokes one, which wakes up and starts trying to function.


The Three arms: Following the destruction of an Arkadimon going mad, attempting to replace the original Apocalymon, three of its arms managed to survive its deletion. These remained a constant in all resets, becoming geographical monuments to the battle of the destined from 01 and the almost destruction of the digital world. 
- Upper Layer. One of the arms is visible to all digimon, and is the reason why there's so many speculations about its origins, down to an entire religious belief centered around the creature whose arm belongs to. For some unspeakable reason, the Sky-Hop HQ is centered on its very palm, albeit nobody has ever had the nads to remove them from such a holy spot. 

- Earth Layer. Five mountains in the shape of claws are said to be the other hand of the beast, and are surprisingly enough a place of tourism with tons of towns and villages that make their living with said legend. 

- Underground Layer. It is thought that there exists a third arm all the way down to the core of the digital world, albeit such a research if never really conclusive and there's a lot of debate wherever or not it exists on the first place. There are rumors of an expedition team being interested in resolving that mystery, although wherever or not it's successful will depend on the digimon that live deep within the world's core.

**Mugen City**: "Waste not want not" is something the digital world takes seriously, to the point where the undying body of a titan-sized machinedramon, rather than to be wasted by the eons of time and digimon looking for an easy prey, became a city bristling with life and commerce. The hardware of the creature became housing and industry, while its circuitry has been tooled and fixed to redistribute power to the many houses. Due to the nature of a digimon, this creature is being kept alive by its inhabitants, the CPU held in one of the most secure places in the city as to keep their livelihood running at all times. Now how did things end up the way they are? One running theory is that this giant Machinedramon was being built in a massive factory in order to attack other continents for resources, something failed and said massive digimon went berserker, destroying everything (including itself) bar the life support that kept its remains running long enough for it to be found and repurposed into a city.

However it happened, the infrastructure of the city is now a bewildering tangle that nearly defies explanation,
even to digimon engineers who understand the operating principles of individual components.
This is perhaps no surprise: The only coherent design notes covering the entire system in any state were made by the
original founders, and centuries of modification and expansion have buried the original vision under patchwork extensions,
jury-rigs, repurposings, emergency repairs, and so forth.

Thus nobody knows the full extent, schematics, or how much of it works, just keep it patched up and assume that the machine
digimon themeing that shows up around the place is just an aesthetic oddity.
Probably a good idea to ignore the number of techs that had nervous breakdowns or retired to become tulip farmers.
It might also be best to ignore the rumours that in places you can hear *words* in the hum of transformers and clicking of relays,
rumours that sometimes when the lights flicker the perfectly normal modern signs change to say Yggdrasil knows what in
an ancient script that makes even mechanical eyes water if looked at closely.

And it's *definitely* best not to look too closely at the oldest structures or behind the rusted access panels with the
sigil of the founders on.
Even the most experienced engineers with encyclopaedic knowledge of the city's systems hesitate to fiddle with
some of *those*, even just moving patch pins or turning knobs, not without a reference for which ones will clear the fault.
Actually using the event taps--an antique method of jacking in--is right out, *nobody* knows what most of those connect to.





Atlantas City: Deep within the bowels of The Great George Gorges lies a hidden city encapsulated in a bubble, where aquatic digimon call home. Thanks to the extremely variable and elastic form of the train rails and the train digimon itself having some minor flexion on what it appeared at first to be inflexible metal, it is possible to visit this place. The large bubble covering this floating mass protects any and all of its subjects and buildings from damage and predators, albeit they are not shy as to not use weaponry against anything big enough going their way real fast, ergo it is often not recommendable to go without a pass or not using the train. Incredibly enough, it is a suburb where regular digimon can work and, thanks to some special coding, the floor apparently does not give even against the heaviest digimon-Although you'll probably end up knocking a few buildings if you try to go big enough.

Heavenly Arm: It is unknown how or why there's a massive arm floating aimlessly around the digital world, some rumors speak of a battle between the god of war and the god of comraderie fighting with their digimon, the beast of blue ripping an arm from the warrior or valour and throwing it to the air, a symbol of its thriump, while the legendary warrior had to replace its now lost limb with cold, unfeeling metal. Wherever as it may be, the data of the arm is...strange, it is almost impossible to properly analyze, modern techniques only give static. However, due to the sheer size, some digimon had decided to live there, and on the palm a Sky-Hop was erected.

Kyle Mountain: An unforgiving, giant snow mountain said to be surrounded by berserker digimon, a cold environment that creates dispute for resources and an almost relentless desire for bloodlust. Although it is not because of some spell or evil entity that wishes to make that place its own, as was originally thought. In fact, it is because of a fruit called a "Dew fruit" that, those that ingest it without processing it properly, will go into a berserking state, trashing and destroying anything on its path. Due to this, the fruit is sought after as, the drink made out of the fruit is said to boost a digimon's constitution, sharpen their minds and make them ready for action in a yiff! The locals call it the "Spiral Mountain Dew" and it is considered a national treasure.

Petaldramon Oasis: It is said that an enormous petaldramon was at the brink of death, having found itself in the middle of the scorching desert for reason yet to be discovered. The first settlers found this dying digimon and, seeing unlimited possibilities by taming this behemoth, decided to restore it to its full health. It took several year, but what was once nothing but a dying, dried-up branch became a massive beast that held atop its back what could be considered a full-on forest. Those that saw the fruits of their labor were welcomed aboard it, and after eating its fruits discovered that the beast produced amazing food. With that, they dedicated themselves to farming and producing delicacies the digiworld has never seen before, creating atop the beast a floral paradise. The most interesting thing was that, seeing as they were farming ATOP a digimon and the vines and trees were as part of its body as any other, being able to decipher how much fertilizer, water and how to combat possible parasites and infections became so easy it was almost laughable! Even an idiot could create a paradise of their own atop the digimon.

This of course brought in more and more digimon who wanted a piece of that land as, despite the massive size of the beast, greed always runs through the code of those that taste success. However, an interesting thing to note, is that the hardwork of the settlers did not only benefit them, but also the petaldramon, as trading commenced with other regions and thus, manure, nutrients and settlers were traded back and forth, and while one might wonder why the beast might love its population: It is because of the fights they often have atop it, often times deleting their own and thus, seeping into the monster more and more data of which it consumes and grows stronger, forming better fruit. This is one of the reasons why the creature often follows the scent of powerful digimon, even if its movement is sluggish, in order to consume more and more data, be it the diginutrients, of those foolish enough to desire power and money atop its back.
