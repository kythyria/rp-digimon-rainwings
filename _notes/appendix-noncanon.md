# Geography
## Sky biome
At great intervals, however, there *is* something besides digimon: islands (of whichever biome) hovering in midair like they've repealed the law of gravity, and flying installations abandoned by their original builders.

Some of these are huge castles, overgrown with immense plants and in varying degrees of ruination under that.
Others are essentially machine or urban biomes as manifested in the sky, built around endoskeletons of immense girders and well-hidden engine pods.
Also in varying degrees of decay, usually.

Some are inhabited by digimon who use them mainly to hold up nests and perches and generally don't see sturdy walkways as necessary.
Inhabited or not, though, it's not all that unusual to find some ancient machine digimon lurking, usually long-since deactivated, but here and there are ones dormant awaiting some unspecified condition.
A few are not only still functional but actually operational, maintaining their installations.

## Wildlands
Not all of the digital world is easygoing.
For various reasons, including the distribution of naturally occurring livestock and other resources, not everywhere is a mix of remote but easily settleable hinterland and bustling towns.

Some is dead, inhabited by nothing at all save ruins or the most intentionally remote installations.

Wildlands are not this.
Wildlands are places where the terrain itself is outright harsh, and the inhabitants harsher.
Many an unprepared digimon, and even human, has perished in the wildlands, victim of the dangerous environment or even their own psyche.

Adventurers who are already toughened up mentally as well as physically can survive pretty well, if they don't mind their own teeth and claws getting a red tinge.

### Wild Jungles
Beauty that can surpass even what one can witness back in the human world, hiding terrifying creatures that are more than willing to fight to the death for the smallest scraps of prey.
The creatures found in areas of thick foliage where no civilization is found are usually in the deep end of feralism, sometimes not even the best Data Squad tamer can bring them to their side.
Even one who succeeds would find they have to do nearly all the thinking for their mon, training it to follow commands and to blunt the sharp corners of instinct into something useful, unlike the initiative-taking partners most tamers have.

In these jungles, it is a digimon-eats-digimon world, where the strong rule and the weak perish, becoming substenance for the winner.
In a more grotesque display of animalistic behavior, some digimon outright tear off parts of their prey in order to fasten the rate by which a digimon decomposes into smaller bits, which can be quite graphic for those unprepared.
However, there exist rather primitive villages composed of digimon that are barely conscious, and while they may be able to communicate discretion is still advised.

### Wild Deserts
When one thinks of deserts, death, decay and drought are usually what comes to mind, yet the digital version of such places couldn’t be far from the truth.
In such extreme climates, the hunt is as dangerous as anywhere else, digimon and tamers alike venturing in this sea of sand in order to fish for creatures that swim through the scorching desert.

Small oases can be artificially created, settlements exist where richness and abundance seemingly contradict the “death” of their surroundings, where nothing should ever grow.
Thus, being lost in the desert might not be a death sentence, as long as you don’t encounter things as equally lucky as you, if not a bit more.
There are even some weird occurrences when, in the middle of the desert, one can find things like fridges or other electro domestics lying around with seemingly no way of ever reaching that place, and definitely not being powered up by anything, yet functioning as if they were.

So salvation might come to the straggler, in the form of a cold one-or several ones, well, as long as it is not something that’s been deliberately put there. It is said that there’s an underground channel, a collection of tunnels dug by digimon that usually lead to either someplace where there’s food or even to civilization. Be careful, however, as these digimon do not seek those places to do trade exactly, and you might end up having to fend off against giant beasts that lurk in these dark tunnels.

### Wild Sky
It's nearly impossible to tell, but actually most of the Sky *is* wild, it's just not very populated.
Much of the hazard is thunderstorms and incredible turbulence... and then you get to truly wild installations.

These might be islands which themselves are wildlands, or they might be more purposefully constructed.
That the latter sort sometimes turns up out of nowhere, relatively close to the ground, is a constant source of work for adventurers, for they might be tame... or might not be.
