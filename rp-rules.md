title: "Rules of Engagement"
---
-	Respect. There’s something to be said between lightly joking and being outright malicious, it is often better to be polite than to be right.

-	Digievolutions. They are all over the place, you have a single wild Devimon taking down the whole digidestined squad without breaking a sweat, and meanwhile you have these legendary Dark Masters known to be both ruthless and uber powerful…getting bodied by Ultimate. What do they have in common? The powerlevels fluctuate in order to make the story more interesting and engaging, ergo we are looking for the same, where the focus is more on roleplaying and everybody having a fun adventure than hyperfocusing on numbers. That being said, don’t expect your just-born Koromon to be able to take on a Wargreymon. 

-	The Digivice are items that allow for the evolution of partner digimon, or for the jogress between a spirit and a human. That being said majority will only be able to have one partner/spirit at the start of the roleplay, with a maximum of three (between solo digimon and spirits, although spirits that belong to a similar/equal line get treated as evolutions of a singular digimon rather than their own entity. For example starting as the Human Spirit of Darkness and then obtaining the Beast Spirit of it counts as a singular digimon rather than two separate entities). The in-universe explanation for this is that majority of digivices are more specialized to handle a singular digimon, and further partners require some special software and hardware that are hard to find.

-	That being said, while lore-wise each digivice has some uniqueness or specialization of it in the original, and in this roleplay the Data Squad’s digivice is a lesser version of Gennai’s design because of it being reverse engineered by humans, when it comes to actually roleplaying there’s really no intrinsic difference between them other than their model nor any actual benefit from using a VERY specific one. 

-	OC digimon are more than welcome, only thing is don’t make them this OP character that can’t be hit and that automatically kills everything it touches. Nobody wants to play with that dude, absolutely nobody.

- If canon specifies there's exactly one of something, players can't claim exclusive right to play it. Either it's off-limits, can be borrowed as an NPC, or there's more than one of it

- Yes, most of this is a bit vague, woolly, and admits inconsistent rulings. We know. Ultimately, the decision rests on the admins as to what's OK. You may need to ask an admin about canonicity, power levels, what's usable, and so forth.

- The Royal Knights... they're blessed by Yggdrasil. Just being Omegamon doesn't make you an RK. Gotta be blessed.
